23,im using lazada all the time and i always have smooth transaction i found out that they have lazpaylater i hope they can offer that me as well since i am a good customer ever since i tried some of their rd party loan providers and i never had issues with them i hope they will notice my account,1
24,why there is no lanao del sur in the address selection,0
25,when my purchase has long been sent to me i don t have any option to update my purchase status manually sometimes i would totally forget about the completed order already and then i received a notification that a product would be delivered to me this create a confusion i thought my account was hacked and used to make unverified purchase,0
26,easy buying for any items that you want to buy,1
27,it s a bad experience it maybe a delayed reviewed regarding the items i ordered i advised everyone do not order phone online go by yourself to check in the trusted phone shop though it may cost expensive and it is has high quality and durability unlike rdering online maybe as cheap but the quality and durability is not good at all every single fils is very important as we work hard to earn it so be wise buying phone online is not an option,0
28,very easy to make an order thank you so much,1
29,literally forces you to use the app instead of their website website constantly bombards you with unusual traffic spams you with sales or live events that you can t turn off the app s notifications categories are smushed into one on android so there s no way of turning promotional notifications off unless you want to miss orders shopee is still bad but its way better than this even official stores are broken,0

67,frauds scamsters poor support system you can wait endlessly for their so called live support which is dead actually cheats announced bank promo and on each page they mentioned the discount will be applied only after the bank debit or credit card is used and you reach the end when you receive no discount and you can t even cancel the order also don t fall for their am big sale farce which is nothing but a waste of time their own lazada wallet doesn t work and blame the banks,0

70,a network of good supplier keep it up,1
71,great shopping app,0
72,i think it s a very cheap tactic to only allow me to customize email setting using the app i only installed the app to cancel all email notifications from shopee why isn t there an option to do that on the website itself,0

94,what kind of company just keep on spamming everywhere,0
95,not very user friendly i ve been using the competition app and so far i m not impressed with how to navigate the lazada app the red alerts button is always on even after you ve reviewed orders my cart also shows that i have something on there when i don t the item page description the reviews even the search option is a mess for a popular shopping app they sure invest poorly on improving it,0
96,great apps with official store some well known brands love to use this when big sale such as etc this apps also improve the key word to search goods,1
97,cheap and easy,1
98,gidbless thank u,1
99,worst does not issue refund for a failed seller ship out weeks of promises for an lbc remittance refund but no code arrived in the email after multiple chat support and escalation scam online theft,0

105,everything was great,1
106,i have been with lazada since and an avid user since then,1
107,can t pay using tngo from app it says insufficient fund,0
108,i made my first order on this app and it was failed delivery the reason that was written by the courier is that i rejected the parcel on my doorstep where in fact he never showed up where i live i did not even receive a call nor a text message that badass delivery partner always used by lazada ninja van now that s a great reason to uninstall this app and use a much better alternative,0
109,so far so good been shopping here for years na items are worth it you just have to read the features and reviews of the items before you buy it,1
110,excellent but wrong order if you using search,1
111,i like the only thing is that the shipping is so poor that it s so long i totally forgot about it,1

113,shopee has really grow better n better with more local establishment joining,0
114,bloody seller dont want to settle the bloody refund,0
115,spam ads keeps on opening play store to force install,0
116,so far i have no regrets or disappointments yet in my purchases from lazada what you see is what you get and if items are not shipped from overseas items are delivered fast,1
117,i just love how your exploitative cashback points system works so cleverly designed that newer points are used first making old points likely to expire such a brilliant marketing tactic to force your customers to use the points and spend more it s not as if sellers in your platform are just inflating their prices in the first place then offsetting them with pseudo cashback vouchers truly an outstanding way to hostage and swindle money out of your customers very nice indeed,0
118,good platform with many goods at reasonable prices,0
119,it s very simple they have good quality products,1
120,thumbs up to lazada keep up the good work service always keep improving,1
121,i hate this ads so many distrub it in youtube,0

127,easy interface lots of choices,1
128,your the best,1
129,why is it that the shipping fee increased so big,0
130,this is now just another shopping platform in asia that allows their sellers to sel fake things at the selling price of authentic things and having no respect for delivery appointments and commitments,0
131,reliable and very easy,1
132,i m unable to view my likes item via laptop,0
133,service is good the items is a good conditions,1

138,good and convenient way of shopping,1
139,app causes my phone hang and was so lagging please fix it thanks,0
140,bad service,0
141,the application works fine by me but the search engine could be a little better i have more issues with the experience that negative reviews somehow disappear from sellers and i absolutely don t like the ads saying buy this phone for million dong when you open up to look it says sold out but we have this very much older model for the same million,1
142,i shop on lazada all the time with my family i have never searched for adult toys but these things keep showing up in the main page worst when i m buying toys for my kids adult stuff should not appear unless searched,0
143,always going for the ads,0
144,irritating can t even look at what lazada is selling without being forced to install on my phone will shop elsewhere,0
145,confirm first the item are available before we pay thanks,1
146,the size ranges are terrible its way easier to find what you want if you re tiny and extremely thin the size m isn t even m,1
147,all good but believe me the refund procedure is times slower than the purchase procedure they take my money for purchases in less than seconds but my refunds take many weeks and is dreadfully complicated come on lazada pull your socks up you know where my money comes from just send it back there instantly,0
148,fast and hassle free time money worthy,1
149,fast and ontime delivery,1
150,iklan nya nyebelin selalu pop up yang spam gitu the ad sucks me because always like spamming,0
151,very bad experience item took more that mth to reach not recommend ask for cancellation on my order seller rejected but item still pending to ship out,0
152,repeatedly declined with lazpaylater shopee is much better and easier to be approved always saying try applying again but with the same declined result,0
153,i just installed the app and i am setting up my address but when i click olongapo it just gives me a blank page why tho,0
154,wow super awesome online shopping,1
155,it s my first time ordering in lazada hope its a good product so i can empress it,1
156,too many seller asking for whatsapp telegram no and looking for dealing out from apps laz should focus more on this laz may help seller on how to manage their stock and how to answer the pm from apps able for buying but after make a payment seller msg buyer and tell no stock available some seller just keep quiete and waiting buyer to contact them first and ask for the current status transfer money from laz wallet to bank account take a long time compare with another platform,1
157,good and easy to use with fast delivery,0
158,service is quite good especially the time of delivevry but some of my order is nmt working,1
159,good but can you stop pop up in other apps i use scanner in my phone to submit my exercise then suddenly lazada app pop outof nowhere this will triple the my stress levels,1
160,easy to access a lot of promo thank you,1
161,super useful and nice app and there s a lot of free shipping and cash backs thanks lazada,1
162,they are canceling the order without a justifiable reason,0
163,star for legit seller and good delivery vouchers are not usable even if it s free shipping yet the sf still appear coins should be applicable for what is being added to cart not on the choice of this app sorry to say but it seems the same issue for other buyers hope it will improve so i will on this app,0
164,shopee is way more better and secure than this trash less protection for the buyers sellers can easily scam buyers thru digital goods,0
165,some times there items are good some times doesn t satisfactory,1
166,very fast delivery but some promotions are very tricky,1
167,poor application at all poor selection of shop to be listed in lazada mall and also poor in refunding system,0
168,faster deliver and good quelity,1
169,showing up everywhere too much ads of lazada showing in other platforms interrupting our experience in other apps,0
170,item received in good condition and same as advertised,1

184,i like that i could add items to a delivery that s already ordered and paid earlier,1
185,good app for online shopping,0
186,trashy customer service and full of scams my order got delivered but it s the wrong one then i want to refund it but i can t because the app says that it s to be shipped what a sucky system it s full of scammers do not recommend,0
187,good app is p for educt,1
188,very convenient keep it up good job satisfied,1
189,my fav shopping app prices are better than other platforms navigation is speedy despite being feature packed search results by top sales is useful image search is great activities vouchers during etc are rewarding only lags occasionally,0
190,fast delivery and friendly personnel,1
191,convenient and affordable shopping experience,1
192,this app so badtrip how about the other person without credit card,0
193,secured purchases and minimal bogus seller,1
194,wow nice saves a lot on sale thank u,1
195,receiving wrong items damaged items incomplete orders slow shipping out by sellers return of item sometimes issue because have to return everything because of item dont know why some orders are tagged as bulk even when totally different items also received insufficient refund amount because of system glitch so always pay attention to the details,1
196,too much ads its too annoying,0
197,easy user friendly app,1
198,very much satisfied with my purchase of abc keto peanut butter,1
199,this lazada search engine really needs for improvement searching results are not match at all with searched item key word it is wasting too much of our time just for finding a correct item we are looking for hard to input review no need sweating to give review,1
200,dont download this app because the courier are so lazy to deliver your item,0
201,i recommend you to order in this shop super bait ng seller fast delivery very accomodated pa,1
202,the product always come on time safe and sound,1
203,easy to use,1
204,tbh i should rate laza stars but i see there are problems like you can t find a chair from a country you want because you have to scroll many times and you wasted your time but still didn t find it example you want a headphone that came from us but you can t find that headset and you only see products that came from thailand hongkong spain and a lot of products always came from china i rarely see a product that came from my country and others its like your online marketing on china,0
205,oh its usual activities i like to buy things i needed it cause of low price compare to others,1
206,sometimes for no reason the shopee app logs me out and gives me an error message and i am unable to access my account however overall experience has been pleasant with sellers,0
207,i ordered discounted items and they have more vouchers for free shipping kodus,1
208,the app itself is good to use a bit of an extra step to track orders though,1
209,lazada improved their app yay kudos to devs finally fixed the display regarding the cancelled order issue now gone from star earlier it s why cs is accomodating shopping made easier with cashbacks vouchers i hope they will continue improving their app,1
210,easy to navigate and applying rebate discount vouchers is a lot more straight forward than so many other online markets this is a major selling point of shopee don t lose this advantage,0
211,very good in service and product quality,1
212,very good for sell or buy everything online,1
213,very annoying pop up ads in other apps,0
214,every time after i paid the seller will contact me said no stock and ask me to cancel order if no stock why want to contact buyer no stock after buyer paid instead of delete the post or change the status to no stock worst experience lol,0
215,my wife and i enjoy shopping in lazada since then it s a very useful app i highly recommend this to the people out there,1
216,very useful application for online shopping,1
217,why was i redirected to this i didn t even search for this app nor did i open my play store i ve experienced this many times already and it is frustrating even when i use my browser it just suddenly redirect to lazada site that s what made me hate lazada k bye i ve already changed the settings of my phone and browser but still redirects to this i don t want to give any star but i can t post this without any,0
218,it doesn t have option to control notification i guess i have explore for so many time cannot find it,0
219,i love lazada it is very easy to use and fast transaction with the sellers,1
220,very convinient and just love it,1
221,i m disappointed failed deliveries and cancellation of orders this apps courier can t reach rural areas even though the roads is applicable for motor users,0
222,great app helps me find what i want by not going anywhere,1
223,fast reliable for online shoppers,1
224,it s getting harder and harder to earn coins except for cashback,0
225,lazada is a very convenient shopping option and in many cases also cheaper than the ordinary stores out there,1
226,this application is awesome even though the product that i was ordered was failed and not as the same as the picture on actual but almost all are excellent,1
227,this app is ok but it needs to be improved especially on the product choices such as color and size,1
228,great product selection hope they have option to filter for best seller to choose from,1
229,your ad is everywhere and is so annoying,0
230,reviews aren t showing on the product page even it tells there are reviews and it won t let me pick cod as an option on any product i try to purchase you just pushed a very bad update,0
231,spaming unnecessary adds while youtubing,0
232,excellent never got problem ordering here hope it will continue the same,1
233,so i like the service itself do i must agree that lazada is one of the trusted platform when it comes in online shopping though lazada must do a big count on screening for reseller because some of them are not that trustful with the product they provide,1
234,sometimes not good because different item you give in my order,1
235,although sometimes a little laggy but overall good app,0
236,not leggings fast and easy,1
237,rat toy,1
238,lazada is customer friendly app i like it so much good job lazada,1

252,got scam on the promotion item from official store updated tracking code but was not on system after weeks only found out i can t ask for refund someone from lazada express msg me did i receive my parcel i said no and they refund money to my lazada wallet the point is from start the product is not even in the tracking system seller just simply put if shopkeeper can t promise to do marketing campaign please don t do promotion very bad user experience,0
253,hi lazada sir you are amazing your all products and services super thank you,1
254,annoying ads everywhere even unnecessary sites they suddenly pop up ads and then open the app automatically totally uninstalling this app,0
255,nice quality items and delivered on time,1
256,not the mobile load offering first users discount on phone credits and then getting refunded at the st slot and to think nthe refund takes almost days to reflect back on the account when their scamming asses can just decline the transaction in the first place trash,0

938,good experience delivery on time sometimes earlier as expected delivery couriers are respectful and well done delivery chores but i would suggest that sometimes you have to give rewards to avid customers even a free delivery like any other online companies otherwise i will give you stars for good service,1
939,when it comes to delivery is the worst they won t even bother to contact you if the delivery is delay and the customer service is damn bad they were laughing while talking to me so unprofessional i asked if i can take myself on their hub of the parcel because i m not going to be at home at the date and they said i have to wait for delivery i can t see what s the problem of taking the parcel on myself,0
940,good app,1
941,why plus code address are not available for delivery address in this app because plus code are more accurate than puting the long address name,1

943,good prompt delivery usually earlier than specified great,0
944,too complicated too difficult to update a phone number or email address too complicated to find options in the app a number of obvious scam offers that you re not filtering app itself is hard to use maybe you can contact the app developer of another shopping platform,0

971,somehow other platforms appear much better now than lazada others have better vouchers higher discounts easier and longer vouchers validity the other online stores navigation and format appears more simpler now not so tricky than lazada,0
972,it s better that you give free shipping vouchers monthly so we can shop here more often at least every month or free vouchers i think would be enough and more shops to accommodate cod payments,1
973,good and easy is the same as saving all the time to get the same stuff as i said so far thank you lazada,1

1037,very good quality and solid material after washing,1
1038,lazada ads are everywhere and not only annoying but it messes with the subconscious mind on the long term their influenced will be cemented in our mind which to my opinion it is quite unethical their ads are forced and similar to a communist style propaganda but in a commercial setting,0
1039,delivery was fast and item received in good order thanks for the professional service,1
1040,lazada helps us to buy more products with reasonable prices it s not confident to say that lazada makes our lives better,1
1041,real cheap but must carefull for spec scam,1

1077,love lazada patong patong na voucher for big discounts,1
1078,we bought this item and after a few months it was defective having a hard time to even ask help to the seller and lazada cs to get a refund in short their policy is not fair its already months and the seller still hasnt done anything even after escalations very unfair policy there are also tons of gadget stores that have fishy good ratings but once you buy it its not the same item or even defective so be careful buying expensive items here,0
1079,lazada have more varieties of products to shop wide choices good app,1
1080,the online mall that has everything from cheapest to grandest name it and they freaking have it 🤣,1
1081,it so nice happy shopping everyone,1
1082,free shipping apps allow max account log in account will get cautch by system and banning from free shipping i the unlucky one who borrow apps to let family log in their account to purchase items and now both account no longer able to use free shipping,0
1083,this vendor sells overpriced chinese made counterfeit products which do not work or are undersized it only sells junk so beware i suggest you don t waste your money i m still trying to get my money back for a broken tv the lazada site sold to me in addition the vendor cancels a lot of purchases so that it can hold up your refund for weeks it funny that lazada can charge your debit card in seconds but it takes weeks for them process a refund currently i have refunds in process for more than pesos the higher the cost of the item it s more likely to be cancelled by this vender so that it can use your money for an extended period of time also this vendor will charge you for shipping costs but will not refund this cost even when they cancel the purchase this vendor is not trustworthy so beware i will not use them anymore they steal all this and lazada responded with a computerized comment that said nothing i want to know where my refunds are for the broken tv and their cancellations of my purchases the lazada site also uses the bait and switch scam this is where a photo shows an expensive item and they will send you a much more cheaper item many chinese sub ventors on the lazada site uses this scam apparently lazada does not police its vendors one of the worst of these vendors is the ttlife kitchen store also steve kyle marketing sold me a broken tv and will not give me a refund as usual lazada doesn t care about it s customers this is typical of its service and management this vendor and it s management are crooks the good reviews are written by lazada employees so i wouldn t trust them,0
1084,ok ang lazada i feel they ve improved in many aspects of what they do in terms of customer relations and the online retail system itself good job kudos lazada,1
1085,having the worst experience yet still haven t gotten my refund do not be fooled by easy return and fast fund it has been days since i ve returned my order with missing parts lazada agent even told me to contact the seller for offline settlement which contradicts their notice not to communicate outside the lazada website app in the end i will have to wait for the order to be returned to seller which the delivery has attempted multiple times already,0
1086,i really trust this up but sometimes there s mistake lazada nots fault only in factory,1
1087,fast and reliable thanks lazada,1
1088,the on line shop application is nice and easy for users suggestion for lazada please delete the seller who is not a mandate and harm the buyer,1
1089,very useful and convenient thanks lazada,1

1098,very easy to use,1
1099,nice there have alot of new thing that i buy for a cheap price,1
1100,not the app itself but their ads it s sooo long and obnoxious that it made me despise the app and switch to shoppe,0
1101,very easy to make online shopping,1
1102,very helpfull and easy to shop,1
1103,i used to think that lazada was alright even with the slightly confusing format however recently the ads have been really unecessary and infuriating i ve seen ads where it shows a random ufo a motorcycle crash some fake chair tiktok video a moving bag being beaten by a couple of men fake security warnings and fake x s to close the ads this led me to completely mistrust this app and highly discourage anyone from using this i like only the ads that actually show what the app is for,0
1104,more items and easy to use,1
1105,i m going to keep this short and simple this app is absolutely amazing and great for all people,1
1106,it s so annoying it keeps forcing me to download it it sucks and the ads soooooo annoying,0
1107,it s help me to buy and sell for extra income this is so usefull and helpfull to me iam a super satisfied costomer,1
1108,it gives me happiness whenever i order something,0

1110,the most convenient online shopping i used thanks,1
1111,able to get good discounts and delivery fast,0
1112,all good and seller are accommodating and responsive to my quiry,1
1113,so far so good but give out reward points i ve been shopping at lazada for quite awhile now and purchased a lot stuff but i don t receive any perks,1
1114,i had a very bad experience from buying items from lazada sayang ang pera ko i really hate lazada pakiusap po sa lazada just stop sending message to my phone na uninstalled ko na ang app nio pero padala pa din kayo ng padala ng message i regret having you in my phone,0
1115,my stress reliever u just have to be wise in purchasing not just carelesly check out great to have evrything i need is all here love it nsa lazada yan,1
1116,delivery staff very polite and very fast,1
1117,fast delivery,0
1118,you have too many ads and your searching system is getting worse,0
1119,i recommend this product because it’s easy and perfect for your hyundai santa fe five stars,1
1120,one of the scam in lazada is they send the item in a group and included other item i did not order in cod how can i return it,1
1121,good quality battery can last for quite long after fully charged,1
1122,now lazada improved experience everything ok now even got rebates for wallet looking forward for more product and experiences,1
1123,in general items on lazada and s h o p e e are cheaper however pls be a smart consumer and compare prices against markets like g i a n t and t e s c o think wisely buy only what you have to use don t waste money splurge on un necessary items u don t need or risk getting broke,1
1124,lazada is simply the best player there is in the era of global online sales and product marketing up to date and high quality a z products and value for,1
1125,i have a card linked on my account and i can t remove it checking payment options it does not appear there be careful on cashing in too much in your wallet while it is safe withdrawal is very bereaucratic you have to send a message to customer support withdrawal will be in days with very limited remittance options,0
1126,app is so buggy after the most recent update thats why i hate updating apps,0
1127,too expensive items,1
1128,so far so good keep it up delivery is up to date giving you star and the packaging is really safe thank you lazada,1
1129,shopee is better imagine having your parcel rerouted far away before being delivered wasting time and resources parcels checked out are subject to waiting for promo events cut off even if the seller is ready for shipping news of expensive parcels being swapped check out hangs and item pictures wont load on promo events lazada should prioritize investing more on servers not on tv ads because their servers cant handle too much load and implement strict security policy in sorting centers,0
1130,what i thought is the price shown is low price pesos but when i click umabot ng pesos ang mababayaran,1

1331,the most wonderful app ever and it s help me with my online shopping,1
1332,i cannot check out when i need to mostly when they have promotions they will give vouchers but i cannot use it they will suggest to check out without vouchers so what is the use of those vouchers upon chatting to a customer service they suggest to do a basic trouble shooting but nothings happen i cannot check out either even i try to remove all the vouchers now i cannot reach someone to assist me i need to purchase some products for my baby s essentials then this is what happened,0
1333,im happy because my order is too fast to deliver so i give u star thank you,1
1334,the vouchers are much easier to find and it automatically applies all the coins or voucher discounts to get as cheap as possible but the only way i want it to be better is allow all items to be able to pay at convenient stores as its easier for me to avoid cod and it tends to have less issue with optimisation unlike shopee it annoys me when it freeze up while i was scrolling last is the options shopee has more options and varieties whereas lazada lacks behind overall its a great app to use,1
1335,hard to use no free for new comers shopee is better,0

1340,good and affordable products very convenient,1
1341,excellent platform for online business lazada should provide an inventory function in the app for the buyer to keep track their groceries i have been using lazada to purchase most of my household and groceries except vege and fresh meat for the last months,1
1342,a little difficult to browse through the item especially when browsing or comparing product i have to load my cart with all the items that i like or similar this is when i review the product specifications,1
1343,lately i noticed lazada have a lot website linked jump to apps so i decided to delete it it s freaking annoying,0

1360,please update bugs on this app parcel receiver not updated to others name during checkout order still using name of lazada owner account as receiver by courier more than times,1
1361,i decided to install the app again because i saw on facebook that there s a lot of items that i want in low price however i tried to add to cart the shoes that i want to buy because it s in low price it was indicated that the price is but when i chose the size the price suddenly changed and it became how am i supposed to buy that i thought the shopping in lazada will be more convenient please fix this thank you,1
1362,this shopping application is good but sometimes bad because one time my order returned to the seller because the courier did not text me that my order is out of delivery and i wait for it for many days,1

1618,trash android app cannot collect vouchers dont use this app,0
1619,notifications are annoying as heck make an option to opt out of useless notifs aside from the order ones don t force us to turn off all of it on our phone settings because on your app even if i turn everything off except for orders i still receive tons of promotional useless junk on push notifications,0
1620,hope the product i order will always be good in quality,1
1621,it keep returning back to the same page whenever i upload the photo on the review section why such a nuisance asking for review with such poor lagging apps what are you expecting page can t load well when we browse to the lower item on every page and it stuck so what do we need to do refresh then have to scroll down again n again i am on the latest version of your apps but still the same issue that is why i don t really spend much here the apps,0
1622,unfortunately there is no option for europe to buy,0
1623,annoying ads everywhere,0
1624,cannot search or view the cart until deleting and reinstalling,0
1625,great online platform to shop,0
1626,i hope lazada would include bookmark section for us to list items we want to buy later instead of adding into cart then annoying messages would pop up asking if we forgot to pay,1
1627,if you only sell in the countries shown then this add is useless in the usa,0
1628,rubbish apps always come out to popup and ads very hate lazada annoy,0
1629,its a type of shopping that you can trust you ll get what you see even though its not really fast in delivering but what you pay is what you get,1
1630,games page still crashing it s been so many hours shopee developers sleeping is it hopeless,0
1631,my orders often got cancelled because sellers fail to ship i may have received order but it took a week for the seller to ship,0
1632,easy to use and convenient,1
1633,no longer has split screen support for samsung devices why would you limit people s access to your app and business doesnt make sense,0
1634,my lazada account can t pay through eleven i do not have an online bank account or vice versa it is very troublesome for me please fix it,0
1635,good app however a lot of merchant doesn t allow pay by cash method or maybe lazada disabled that option could have been better if more merchants allow this method,1
1636,greatest place for shoping in vn,1
1637,one of the best online shop easy to use one thing i recommend is the received button for the buyer for them to notify the seller that the parcel item is now fully deliver,1

1643,facing error in cart can t open cart,1
1644,fast deliver always in good condition the item when arrived,1

1646,dissapointed after proceed payment than got information cancelation by supplier due can t delivery,0
1647,please enlarge your font it looks too crowdy and causes a bit of mental stress it doesn t look appealing plus the white background color makes it look like a piece of bond paper maybe atleast add some theme or dark mode options too much brightness hurts my eyes my heart my liver and my lungs,0

1664,event scamming u hardly win anything on the event nonsense coin u hardly can claim anything from the coin obtained by purchasing mostly coupon that required u to buy high total amount of purchase expensive pricing lack of choices so my suggestion is shoppe or ali baba ir any other online store,0

1699,sellers were great but delivery couriers tend to fail the delivery intentionally so they could have a qouta for the day and will still receive their pay while sitting pretty hence the parcel will just go back to the seller without them delivering it filing a complaint wont do because of poor customer service this happens to a lot of customers i suggest not to use this app it wastes your time,0

1813,i enjoy shopping in lazada because it is convinient and there are lots of items that are very affordable thumbs up still waiting for my first ever product that i purchased from lazada and hoping it would turn out as good as they have said in the descriptions and reviews,1
1814,slow customer service especially with related to refund go to shopee better,0
1815,love it,0
1816,as a new customer it is hard for me to know how to apply those promo code i don t know where it should be applied you collect it but it is not automatically applied during check out and promo code is always invalid you should know how to satisfy your customer you should doin your job as a seller where you giving the needs and wants of the customer and althroughout the transaction you should make them feel satisfied with your product and it should be free shipping if it is within manila,0
1817,very limited running shoes and gym equipment options,1
1818,ads from lazada are being forcefully opened without user interaction this is such poor and offensive behaviour,0
1819,could this app ff n stop the ads i ve uninstalled this already and i still get ads which is very irritating,0
1820,we can buy something and i very love this app,1
1821,the app performs fine but i wanna highlight some problems with the coin system and vouchers they are useless you can t use it for anything except specific items worst for those that expires in a short time lazada if you wanna know why your earnings took a dive it s because you ain t competitive at all,0

1827,on line order is fast and easy however im not quiet sure if item s will be delivered on time,1
1828,delivery is too long i m very disappointed,0
1829,please prohibit your sellers from doing false advertisement from my own personal encounter with the seller prior buying some sellers admit that their products are not as displayed come on lazada this initiative will not burden your sellers either since they only need to spend a couple of minutes to snap the products they have by using their smartphone they have and just upload them afterwards false advertisements are further worsened by the lack of buyers review and number of buyers,0
1830,seller chats available but no use automatic answer with unrelated question by buyer keep reply the same thing useless whos stupid created this stupid system to help seller to earn money but no service at all,0
1831,very good applicstion online shop,1
1832,thank u for always delayed delivers,1
1833,so fast delivery and affordable prices,1
1834,lazada is ok but our location has erased by lazada that is why we cannot shop,1
1835,the app is definitely better more intuitive than the web access it s easier to navigate also more fun with all the coins to be won,0
1836,good,1
1837,sometimes disappointed but still im enjoying placing orders,1
1838,love this apps so far theres only one thing i dont know how to place my order in one place instead of separate orders in every product so what happens is every product i paid shipping fee is it possible if i got diff products to order it could be one shipping fee only instead of separate order i paid shipping fee every orders of the product,1
1839,good deal at lazada,1
1840,good service but lately the delivery was more than the expected timeframe and there was this one time that my item was mark deliver but i did not received the item yet but after the report i made is that they delivered the item but the packaging for me is like tampered and was already unsealed bcoz they use double sided taped to seal back the blue packaging of lazada plastic packaging star because of that,1
1841,i like discount but this app had no discount so i just buy something s without discount s,1
1842,i can give star for now maybe later when i receive my parcel,1
1843,too much sketchy schemes under the name of lucky draws or some stuff like that useless coins too slow to withdraw money i had withdrawn some money from my lazada wallet and still haven t got it for almost two weeks now awful service also can you reduce your stupid ads a bit it s literally everywhere on other apps i can tolerate if its just a display or banner ads but god why do your ads always force me opening the lazada app it s freaking annoying,0

1953,trully a great experience in online shopping,1
1954,why just recently my app always encountered signal traffic on my mobile data network even if it has a strong signal,1
1955,love the new look still need time to get used to new interface,1
1956,very less payment option now they don t accept merchantrade visa they only accept local bank there s no cash payment like kk etc those who don t have passport and ic nothing can buy from lazada every one need to go to shopee shopee have kk payment option in malaysia there s a lot of people who don t have passport and ic now everyone shop at shopee because of they have cash payment option,0
1957,i got many lazada ads on website and waste time so i download it ok,1
1958,lazada has given me the opportunity to be provided access to items that are not readily available locally in my area and access to cheaper valued items in the online market although risks exist of not being provided with great services by bad sellers and couriers lazada reduced these risks through their effective refund system thank you so much lazada for these opportunities and thank you for enabling me to access great products,1
1959,very disappointed with the refund option i had to contact the seller directly and send them a screenshot instead ive already send all the required facts such as video to the customer service personnel but still need to do another step product received was already defective still need to go through the hassle myself,0
1960,fast deliveries and safe items,1
1961,convenient and affordable,1
1962,really like load sale,1
1963,easy to use plus safe transaction,1
1964,the shopee games don t even load the coin earning games such as shopee throw mystery box refuse to load properly even after reinstalling the app restarting my phone every time i try to play they just give me white black blank pages i m deprived of all the discounts,0
1965,fast and easy online shopping,1
1966,great and affordable,1
1967,great service so far sometimes the only problem is the courrier and you must watch out for bogus sellers by reading product reviews,1
1968,i so much hate this app with their pop up ads,0
1969,the delivery is so fast it took days for my mom to receive her order i definitely recommend this the sellers are kindhearted and legit,1
1970,very bad system please improve the system it is difficult to make payment and there are often problems when ordering from lazada,0
1971,very convenient shopping and gives you a lot of hoices,1
1972,the refund system is horrible and the guarantee s are hard to believe most of the time the customer service is also terrible on the app they say that customer satisfaction and service is a top priority but the actions and actual service on the app doesn t really reflect this,0
1973,ship out date are changing which means the shops are selling items with no actual stocks count,0
1974,generally good experience purchasing via shopee recommended,0
1975,nice app with free shipping and affordable,1
1976,i love lazada i think ive been addicted to it yeah,1

1979,nice app everything i order was recieve in good contition all item arrive on time perfect app for who lazy to go shopping outside,1
1980,easy to order,1
1981,good products variation can improve more easy navigate screen loading time is fast compared to others,1
1982,the apps used to transparently display the seller s location helping buyers to decide if we want to buy from certain countries states or to wait for long delivery time especially from overseas but lazada has now removed that useful info and i m forced to wait too long for the products that i need urgently and the prices of some chinamen are no longer cheaper but more expensive than the local sellers lazada is providing the platform for the cunning china sellers to cheat the buyers again,0
1983,so satisfied this app,1
1984,lazada is very easy to use this app is also very pleasing to the eyes of its user thank you lazada,1
1985,what you see is what you get ang ganda ng item thank you seller and sa nagdeliver,1

1987,the app is too messy too many pop up ads too many button presses that are unnecessary,0
1988,good i like sendo,1
1989,its amazing user friendly,1
1990,wow so nice very affordable prices,1
1991,terrible experience with delivery rider all the effing riders are super lazy they will mark your order as failed delivery even without any attempt to deliver they will take their time delivering the items and they are going to put the blame on you by putting various reason like you rejects the item or you asked for reschedule even tho you and the rider never even have any conversation,0
1992,as of now all items that i order in this app is excellent n i hopefully it is forever thanks coz it easy to buy anything that i want,1
1993,good,0

2151,lazada doesnt give free shipping for a minimum cost you need to spend around to avail the pesos free shipping unlike shoppee wherein they give shipping vouchers a lot depending on the time and their promo thats why you always place top on the chart give us free shipping vouchers more provide more logistics to cater our deliveries php shipping fee is like mandatory,0

2225,worse app ever delivered my first item very late and the seller was not responsive to my follow up its even harder to connect to csrs and when i finally able to they told me different information until i had to cancel my order due to loss of trust to my paid item that i cant received when of the csr told me my refund was being process after weeks the item arrived to my surprise when i already bought another one from a physical store there i had dining table and i cant even declined it,0
2226,i accidentally select confirm received already msg the seller but now is when i check my tracking number the status indicate confirmed lost msg the seller but the seller went mia for days seller get the payment but i get nothing can i get my refund back i email to the shopee support times but no reply,0
2227,its good easy to order,1
2228,to much pop up ads and it s so laggy my sister recommended this up but to say this to her this up is not good it is worst annoying my phone became laggy because of this app,0
2229,when i saw something from facebook from shopee and click shop it should bring me to the item in the shopee sg app instead i have to look high and low for it and eventually can t find and give up,0
2230,it is actually excellent as long as you are meticulous and smart buyer 🥰,1

2247,please lock screen for typing of product description not able to see the text being keyed can be frustrating payment to sellers can be expedited while we make the effort to provide a good customer experience we hope to be paid promptly too perhaps add c o d as another option for edit of photos eg brightness on top of sliding can you add in plus and minus it is easier for minute changes thank you very much,0
2248,i rate is because i want buy a cellphone and this is so beautiful,1

2252,annoying app open by it self when we on other app,0
2253,at first was fantastic but now you asked for different thing shopee will corner you to other things furthermore some of the sellers are not serious about selling and not sincere nowadays getting similar with geeks,0
2254,purchases during sale like were cancelled or fail to be delivered by seller apparently it is only click bait to lure buyer to their shop lazada failed to filter their sellers and remiss to safeguard its users buyer,0

2901,basic shopping platform coins can t do nothing as they still limits you from using coins unlike shopee where coins can be used to redeem with anything,1
2902,been using this app for the years and the longer i ve been in this app it s too complicated to used all the said free shipping and the promo vouchers there s difficulty also in this app specially if you want to used your collected coins for a certain item to lessen the amount of the item purchased and the app is the one who always choose as to the courier of the item who will deliver unlike shopee there is a portion there in there shipping that you can choose a courier will deliver the item,0
2903,there s a lot of bogus seller in this platform,0
2904,lazada is the leading online shop in ph but there s one thing i regret the most lazada has no confirmation check in lower right that confirms that the product is already added to your wishlist i usually wants this option for lazada because it will going to help window shoppers like me to know if the product is already in my wishlist for me to know what products i m going to buy first before adding a new item in my wishlist i usually sees the lower right check confirmation in wish online shop,0
2905,very easy to make a deal and apordable price,1
2906,at least offer discount voucher for shipping fee,1
2907,lazada very slow on delivering items takes weeks plus to deliver unlike shoppee so fast only days going back to shoppee faster transaction,0

3060,they should sometimes offer free shipping with no minimum spend like others,1
3061,everything is good however just on the parts where many sellers actually dont reply to chats within the app which defeats the purpose of the message function maybe you guys can improvise on the chat system such as to provide benefits when customer buys and rate the seller instead of just rating the product,0
3062,very nice apps easy to find what i want to look,1
3063,do you know that your delivery partner sucks i gave them star and there s still no improvement till this day since you still leave this unresolved you get star too,0

3108,lot of free shipping legit apps,1
3109,a good online shopping website,1
3110,its fun shopping in lazada,1
3111,im also justine maybe because your sellers are not scared of your policy there is not enough sanctions for them to make sure that they are legit and sell only what they advertised i suggest lazada should become very strict with the sellers when a product is wrong or damaged they can report the product and lazada should investigate and if it is really the sellers fault they should reward the consumer with the product for free this way the sellers will make sure every detail before they ship,0
3112,great app and service enhancing some menus will be greatly appreciated,1
3113,nice and very cheap all items,1
3114,i dont like your auto bot no live agent to talk the return refund takes long to process and end of rejecting its not the buyer s fault if returning the items for the damages when you deliver it i won t use this app again never,0

3291,nice to order and they deliver in time,1
3292,hello i have a few suggestions on some useful features you may add to your application i would like to suggest a sold count on the products so that we may know how many of these products have been sold this helps us guarantee how reliable the seller is based on how many people purchase their products my second suggestion is another delivery option your shipping fee is always the same amount and compared to your competitors you have a much more expensive shipping fee,0
3293,terrible shopping app no returns no refunds always the dispute is settled towards the seller customer service sends no replies seriously i ve deleted my app don t waste your time downloading this unless you are in mainland china,0

3322,seller is innocent lazada held great responsibility for the delivery part and arrangement with courier agent arranging a courier company like ninja is purely miserable they update the status as delivered but the fact was the parcel didn t even delivered it was delivered to poslaju for they do not have services in labuan lazada refused to update the status from delivered to undelivered instead they solve the case by refund my money lazada is reluctant and lazy to solve my issue by simply,0
3323,good product good price,1
3324,i have one word for you bodoh why would you redirect me to play store to download apps are you forcing people to download your apps by redirecting them here for the past few months i have been redirected here so many times that i had lost count and it has become ridiculous absurd and annoying,0
3325,i ve been using this app for a long time and still it s improving and the best shopping platform for me over the other thank you lazada i hope you will add on your order platform a comment section for the request of the customer and reminders overall extremely satisfied 🤟 🤟,1

3330,hi shopee had a wonderful experience before the current update page doesn t load at all upon clicking happens to all the pages in the app using note with android ver hope to see update s before the actual day,0
3331,can i only get cupcakes even thought i score in the game,1
3332,lazada flash express is still very inefficient but they managed to deliver my packages please remove them from ur list of delivery companies the search function is still problematic has more misses than hits ordering on the app is a pain as takes some time to find the exact items flash sales page has stablized without auto refresh topup from online bank has failed again points gained from the games are useless also there must be an easier way to report on scamming cheating vendors,0
3333,not sure what is going on but my followed stores list is not showing all the stores seems to currently only show maximum of stores,1
3334,great app for online orders lazada has a wide variety of products selection it s kinda of like having amazon in the philippines,1
3335,the best online shopping app ever,1
3336,although there is a wide choice i would prefer a wider choice locally sourced but the info is included each time so it s easy to pick items nearby i guess it s the merchants prerogative not to have everything in stock at all time,1
3337,much worse than before when they having live streaming we can t open flash sale page,0
3338,easy to usr and conveneint to place order,1
3339,good item sayang at ala ung color na gusto ko pero ok na din purchase ko,1

3349,its so easy i ordered many times delivery man is always up dated me when merchandised is delivered,1
3350,one of the convenience store so far right here in my cellphone where in anytime you need to see those products prices are affordable but sometimes quite tricky and pictures are not match when the products arrived it s really full of tricks and have to be careful with plastic cabinets the best sale done on january waa prices are it s lowest about those rewards and vouchers benefits quite crazy deals with it some of the errands to run found here in lazada so easy to find out,1
3351,the item are good and they respond fast shipping are on the time thank you lazada you keep my family happy even im here in saudi,1
3352,the app itself works great mostly search results are based on my browsing history and ordering is a breeze the only thing i d like is better package tracking updates many times i don t receive any tracking updates after the day the seller warehouse has packed my order then for example days later i receive a stack of tracking updates for the days prior,1
3353,credit debit txn still not working apps too slow for high traffic during sale,0
3354,too many pop up easily to lost focus to shop items in the list cant select product only in the country,0
3355,all my purchase from lazada was great you just have to carefully read the details of the items you would like to purchase thank you,1
3356,i ve tried many time to download this app but every single time it s not in english and i can t find the english version anywhere one star from me,0
3357,there s one thing which is irritating in this app there should be an option to remove a voucher it gives stress if you accidentally press a wrong choice of discount specially if there s an option which is bigger discount so stresssssss,1

3394,very nice and easy to buy tnx lazada,1
3395,the return policy is confusing they should fic this problem everything else is just nice,1
3396,can t make a lazada wallet or link my mobile number to my email account because i apparently made an account with my mobile number years ago apparently can t combine accounts and deleting an account means the number can t be reused such an inconvenient barrier to switching to lazada from shopee,1

3405,love it so easy and reliable,1
3406,they don t deserve the star i have ordered an item and it was faulty on arrival i have let both the seller and lazada know on the same day the item was returned and i asked for a refund i yet to receive the refund lazada is telling me the seller is the one to refund me and the seller is telling me lazada are the ones to refund me i don t have my money nor do i have a product at this point i just wanted my money and be done with lazada,0

3450,it is may and the ui for tablet has worsen with popups and is whole unsuitable for use on a tablet i just can t believe it the other negative thing is that sellers will keep messaging you in the inbox there is nothing we can do about it,1

3464,pros great discount quality products and legit suppliers con shipping fee,1
3465,it s good shopping app but i kinda confuse with the use of cashback and coins i hope lazada will let us choose how much we want to redeem from the cashback and coins when checkout give us more flexibility shop lately has been quite generous with their discounts and also there is rm cashback limit for a day why was that i hope lazada can improve,1
3466,most of the time pictures are not loading when i m connected to my wifi it s only loading when i m using my mobile data,1
3467,very convenient to use been shopping for years now,1
3468,great deals friendly and informative user interface,0
3469,thank you for giving great experience in online shopping apps lots of discount voucher to offer as well,1
3470,i used to love lazada a lot but lately i ve been having trouble first my order status is not up to date parang pinapatagal ang pag ship tapos my app kept crashing until lumitaw na ang update option sa play store however dahil nagclear data ako before updating nagkaroon ng problem sa log in ultimo pag forgot password ko sa browser sinasabing hindi naka register yung email ko nakakalungkot at nakaka frustrate lalo t hinihintay ko yung package ko sana para sa special na occassion,1
3471,fun shopping lots of discount,1
3472,thank you so much lazada,1
3473,nice to be part of me thank you to fast diliver my order very nice,1

3475,low shipping fee and lot of voucher,1
3476,good app affordable price too,0
3477,only sometime slow delivery,0
3478,it s really nice apps it s so easy to use,1
3479,so far all items i bought and delivered were functional,1
3480,some sellers are not trusted selling fake items fail to deliver lazada should keep watch on this issue shoopee seller are more trusted,0
3481,this is the best apps store and easy method payment,1
3482,the sellers deliver the item a little bit long,1
3483,the latest updates have made the app less usable as searching for a specific item now yields irrelevant results ie random junk that you can t filter off this is especially frustrating as the number of shady stores seem to be increasing with seemingly no attempt at quality control or proper curating by lazada,0
3484,great easy way to order,1
3485,so easy to use and so many good deals always using it huge sale is always there i love it,1
3486,for android user lazada didn t gave us a feature to refresh a page so it s too hard to reload a page if we want to reload we have to go back and then click the banner again which take a longer process than refresh the same page and one more why did you made so many differences between android and ios user booo too bad the algorithm of the system itself sucks actually,0
3487,good app but there are missing links on pages when you want to view your cart and returning to homepage would really appreciate also if you will put a security feature when linking gcash and bank the app automatically deducts without even asking for an authentication to the rd party app,1
3488,zero start third party app will allow it to automatically open this app without me opening this app,0
3489,please add a feature to allow phone location to pin precise location on map like shopee my home address is kinda mess up and i worry if i buy anything you guys gonna send to wrong address i can t stress enough how annoying it is that you guys still don t have this feature when you and shopee already in this business for years and yet still don t add this feature and rely on ancient style fill in the blanks address form so stupid,0
3490,the things all i ordered from lazada all super nice i like very much,1
3491,so fast and easy to understand friendly app,1
3492,super convenient and fast,1
3493,please make it more easier to much of unnecessary notifications,1
3494,cashback before you can use all of your cashback in one particular item and now it is divided and you can no longer use it fully in a single purchase this is actually the reason why i do love shopping in lazada because of the cashback i do ask my friends and relatives to purchase using my account so i could earn cashback and use it fully in a single purchase but sadly it changes and my willingness to purchase through the app has already gone and i switch to tiktok shop shopee,0
3495,since the update this week the app doesn t function normally if i m buying a product the top most part of the screen cannot be seen pls fix the bug,1
3496,terrible experience with using credit card bank vouchers and i have given the same feedback to the customer service countless times and each time they promise to escalate the issue to it for resolution it has been months but to date nothing has been resolved to ensure the bank voucher is not automatically applied on checkout i have to intentionally reduce my purchase amount so that i don t enjoy the discount just so that i can complete the purchase what a joke,0
3497,it s so helpful because if you ordered a thing it will delivered as soon as possible,1
3498,oke,1

3510,very bad and slow in refund took them two and a half month along the way with phone calls saying they are processing it and a few emails on the estimated date of refund which never happen i ve contacted them more then times on this i have stop shopping in lazada,0

3635,lazada is kinda trash when you open it on website not like the other ones you cant confirm your order on website when you have tapped confirm on the app then you uninstal the app then install again the button confirmed changed at the first place which means that it s no use whether u tap confirm or not imo lazada isnt user friendly it s kinda difficult for me to understand how lazada works or maybe i m too stupid to understand but the shipping costs offered by lazada is affordable,0
3636,on time delivery and safe packaging especially those from flagship stores from lazmall,1
3637,sorry to do this but i have to say it s a bit weird for me that seller has days to prepare for sending out goods i understand maybe they have to get the items ready but the better way is to have good by hand and can send out goods asap right after the payment is confirmed and i realized that i couldn t even reach online seller first time user and the service bot just really disappointed human beings days should be maximum for goods ready otherwise don t put the goods on website,0
3638,why i can t login and i can t sign up because the code can t send i hate too much,0
3639,user friendly lots of promote coupons event responsible for unmeet satisfaction items,1

3644,lazada express is super slow last time used to be big fan of lazada every parcel need to wait at least days to reach shopee has cheaper courier fee and deliver much more faster than lazada no point to use lazada,0

3674,good quality at all worth the money,1
3675,good app,1
3676,needs improvement lazada needs to improve the way to set up the accurate location of the parcels receivers by using a map to point out the exact location of the buyer i didn t received my parcel because there is no settings section to edit and point out my address exact location it is not using a map i think that is one thing you need to improve shopee is using a map for the buyers to be able to set the exact location of their house so the riders can easily deliver the items,1
3677,it s easy and convinient to order amazing,1
3678,good app,1

3879,good service but please make more vouchers for free shipping tq,1
3880,horrific advertising lazada advertises itself on websites that have both sexual content and pirated anime this means it supports those kinds of websites in fact this means that it pays those kinds of websites to exist also it does that thing where it forcibly redirects you to lazada or this page wherever you click in some websites really cool nice advertising very good it is very good at annoying people good idea,0
3881,very nice app its easy to buy items,1
3882,this app is really good however it needs to be as simple as possible for the users also the buyers,1

4208,lazada deserves star their returns and refund process takes too long and cs deserves star as well i ve had enough lazada my request way back almost months ago still wasn t addressed all because of your faulty processes i gave everything i can but no one else understands my situation i don t think there is a language barrier you should call complainants regarding complex issues my experience with you was very remarkable to zero,0
4209,initially gave stars because my first few orders were good and i had a good experience until my last one their system is direct to the point the only disadvantage customers suffer the consequences because of their so called system or guidelines i had my last package be sent back to the seller just because i wasn t there receive it but it apears as though i refused to accept the order instead,0

4366,all my order in this apps are good i never expirience that i refund or scam so i loved to use this apps when i have so many like that i will not use any effort i used to recomend this apps in all people i know,1
4367,good application and easy to order,1
4368,damn their courier service are the worst in history if you get lex express your item will arrive but very damn slow but if you get urban despatch as ur courier your item will never arrive better use shopee,0
4369,they said you can cancel and switch if you’re not happy with what you recieve but the truth is they will make lots of problem when you ask to change your stuff which was damaged by their delivers or simply just inresponsive deny their responsibility to their customers if there was a button that rate “worse than the worst” then tiki deserves it,0
4370,i think it s really helpful for those who can t go to shopping malls but i don t like something it s when we order something but get something,1
4371,very good service especially the rider thanks,1
4372,while other ecommerce has their one time chance to change address when the goods had already been paid lazada does not has it admin csupport really not helpful asking same question but with different ppl it just frustating and definitely will use the orange and green ecomm afterwards,0
4373,this app is awesome cheap but has very good quality products,1
4374,generally very satisfied however there are lot of scamers on your platform some stringent vetting will help,1
4375,got my account deactivated for no reason i did contact the cs which frustrated me more anyway they said i can t be on the app without giving a clear reason,0
4376,i have been using this app for a very long time but today this app disappointed me i ordered one product and they cancelled it after taking the payment the refund is taking so long and we foreigners cannot even use lazada wallet now i have no idea how i can get my refund i tried to live chat but it says everyone is busy yea you should think that your customers are also busy if you don t have your products in stock why do you put it for sale it s very disappointing,0

4385,it s a joke if you are looking for a good deal forgot this app they are just trying to lure into the network they let you buy it then they will cancel it giving you some funny reasons as if it not the company s fault profit margin is the only thing they see with their customers the dealers they don t even wanna answer me when i confronted them just a few clicks away to buy stuff from the app when items go missing i went around for a month searching for my items,0

4388,the app is user friendly and good customer service care attentive and polite thumbs up,1
4389,please make the app user friwndly and easy to navigate,1
4390,for as long as every google product search link to a lazada product forces me to download this app instead of viewing through the web browser i ll not buy through the platform most products are available as well on shopee or qoo anyway i m even able to browse on taobao on a browser through some hoops this is the only site that rigidly dictates user experience for years,0
4391,all items seems to be from china even if shop says domestic sg delivery takes an average of weeks to over month you give a rating for the seller that s star and you wont get the shoppee coins not happy and probably wont purchase from shopee again,0

4546,lazada is trying to steal my information ลาซาด้าพยายามที่จะขโมยข้อมูลเรา upon launching the app my phone notified me that lazada pasted from your clipboard this happened on version i used it quite often but this unintentional pasting information is getting scary ตอนเปิดแอพ มือถือจะบอกว่า lazada pasted from your clipboard ทั้งๆ ที่ไม่ได้ทำอะไรนอกจากเปิดแอพ น่ากลัวนะ ถ้าก็อปอะไรสำคัญๆ ไว้ โดนขโมยข้อมูลไปหมด ลบแอพพทิ้งไปก่อนละกันนะ ช่วงโปรประจำเดือนก็ไม่ต้องขายให้กัน,0

4553,it was a wonderfull app a really must have now a days everyone is staying at home you can have what you want at a comfort of your own home very good,1
4554,pathetic lex ph courier use shopee yes they have items but their incompetent courier is trash no point in ordering if you wont receive it i know it s not the seller s fault but the damn courier lex ph i ordered items and consecutive times i notify the delivery employee about the product after they text they don t even try to contact back or call and then they mark my item as delivery failed despite receiving the same orders way back before and at shopee it s just disappointing,0
4555,how do i avoid lel service no options given at all not even an indication that overseas seller will use lel offers no flexibility at all i would prefer to be able to collect it at delivery centre instead of having the items shipped back to seller without any refunds,0

4561,i don t have to go out to shop esp this season sobrang traffic and siksikan super convenient,1
4562,the always pop up from nowhere feature is sooooo annoying that i finally decide to uninstall this app and use another marketplace app,0
4563,always has error unusual activity detected when checking out lazada cs replied that i was violating for misusing voucher under their terms conditions which is stupid because what you see on your account that can use vouchers are available to use but their system is blocking you from checking out they ask to try checkout without voucher and it work but once you use their voucher it will go back to unusual activity detected even on their they wont let you use voucher,0
4564,ads spam fake close button x in the ads annoying ads way worst than shopee some ads make my phone storage running low,0

4594,delivery logistic team tends to be irresponsible and simply cancel orders vouchers claims usually not eligble to apply on purchases many scam ads sellers in the portal need to put effort to ready descriptions and check with sellers before each purchase requires proper planing and wisdom to do online shopping now p,0
4595,its a clean ui hope it can be more cleaner i mean simplicity and dark mode option also data saver mode can be helpful here and option for disabling auto play of videos when browsing items,1
4596,i give it star the shipping fee is on every thing you buy you have to pay fee s on everything you buy and also i bought a phone case and it was too small everything is low quality i dont like it,0
4597,vouchers are scam i used a voucher which is supposed to save me money but they won t allow me to checkout because apparently there is a suspicous activity in my account now i removed the voucher and the checkout was successful so technically they will give you vouchers but won t allow you to use them scam scam scam,0

4676,stars only because there were items i bought which were missing in my previous orders i know it was the shop s fault but lazada should do something to make things straight,1
4677,seller can do fake reviews i ve brought an item which is full of hundreds of good product reviews from fake customers when my item has arrived i was totally disappointed already requested for a refund and sent an issues and clear evidence but the seller still arguing and not accepting my refund they can disapprove your request to return items due to certain issues customer s should wait days period for lazada s decision to refund if seller refuses hassle,0
4678,mostly pleasant experience except one thing i cannot zoom out or perhaps pinch outwards to expand the picture or the wordings in the selection screen this is necessary because especially some pictures or words are really small plus sometimes we need to see the finer details in the picture,0

4730,scammers lucky box turns into lucky cylopine please dont rate this apps its a scamming apps,0
4731,ok lah but difficult to differentiate local or china when we put button local still item from china show up,0
4732,just wanna say i hate the way you guys advertise your application please stop using pop up method to advertise your frickin apps or platform its soooo annoying and that way of advertisement will only gain hatred from the users who doesn t need the app at that moment this annoying thing had been happened to me for a while now,1
4733,the others product the sample is org but if you order already and reciv not the same in actual photos sad to say already paid before dliver pls review esp the color more power,1
4734,the critical information such as installment discount cashback all are not clear and not transparent till you make the final payment,0
4735,fast deliver and good service,1
4736,good,1
4737,very excellent application and service,1
4738,customers are satisfied excellent,1
4739,bad service,0
4740,dang lazada you impressed me again you never disappoint me in terms of your speed of delivery i have an item that stayed with the seller for a long time but you were able to deliver it within hours after it was picked up you are truly living up to your motto mas mabilis sa lazada unlike the orange app that i always have to contact customer support just to expedite my orders they sometimes even exceed the edd,1
4741,it s easy to purchase and i love the sales,1
4742,very convenient to buy everything,1
4743,excellent service only from lazada,1
4744,easy to search and compare price,1
4745,nice apps easy to buy,1
4746,the app is well developed but on my experience it needs easy return system support on defective or wrong item by seller because after sales support seller is mostly no show in return nd problem is mostly on the carrier with no corrective action plan on courrier side and after sales support also show negative feedback of courrier and seller on buyer who have transact for other buyers transparency notice some sensored,1
4747,fast and easy,1
4748,not a good app the voucher bugs have exist for years and not fixed slow delivery and packaging paylater not for everyone too many seller scam etc,0
4749,i enjoy shopping with lazada 🤗,1
4750,app crashes constantly or gets stuck at a page convoluted ui with confusing direction the saving grace is that at least it s still better than the website,0
4751,i love buying in lazada the product is very good the delivery is fast as well as the delivery man they are all nice,1
4752,i can t seem to check out it will load for mins but it will only show a white page,0
4753,constant bugs checkout not working search doesn t work well translation not working on product reviews no translation on product detailed description can t make the photos larger on reviews but this is probably the best of all evils from the other shopping apps,1
4754,most products are reliable and authentic oftentimes delivery period is earlier than expected and has the best refund policy compared to other online shopping platforms lazada has various products to choose from,1
4755,convenient to use even if im not home my kids can just received the order without hustle,1
4756,i ordered items and i really love it 🥰🥰🥰 the fabric is very nice i will order more because i received the item early as i have requested to them thank you so much i highly recommend ur products,1

4764,beware lazada is a online scam parcel stuck at their logistics facility since request to cancel on and was promised refund within working days still yet to receive my refund on all i got is an email from them telling me case is closed and do not reply them sounds exactly like a online scam,0
4765,i just love this app so i installed it again hahah but the shipping fee is too much,1
4766,difficult ui and coupon usage,1

4784,enjoy shopping from here very convenient,1
4785,good app with good deals only downside is there may be sellers who don t understand english making communication with them extremely difficult i got around the problem by communicating in chinese good that the app supports chinese text also many of my items are actually shipped from china it s like paying less for something not needed in a hurry good deals with local stocks are definitely a plus like my recent purchase of pet product,0
4786,lazada is good,1
4787,it s so nice to shopping,1
4788,seller sells fake items and then closes down his shop no mechanism to communicate with lazada directly except for chatting with an agent who is busy all the time very bad experience,0
4789,after update the screen resolution page too big for mobile viewing having issue when click into shopee will be kicked out from app and need to re launch app again also shopee customer support response is slow and sometime no response shopee farm harvested item order was cancelled without refund or replacement,0
4790,lagging abit if not star,0

4797,i can find just about everything i need on lazada tracking and notifications are good had a wrong item delivered once and got a refund within a few days,1
4798,from pesos to pesos on credit card all comes to the province house in small town,1
4799,seller pov i had listings disappearing suddenly i didn t delete them nor was i notified of any potential violations of toc not only did i have to replace them i lost the sale count reviews for my products that can help buyers my business buyer pov my dad needed help buying from shopee being overseas i logged into his acc using my phone shopee immediately flagged his account as suspicious so his acc now cannot use referral coupons for his st purchase same happened to mum,0
4800,it would be better if there s a cap on the chargeable shipping fee for customers buying through various sellers,1
4801,this application self launches when other applications are running clearly an advertising integration i have not given the app permission to do this if this action is not immediately changed i will escalate to the appropriate google teams,0
4802,every time open other apps this lazada ads pop up really disturbing lah lazada fadeup with you guys pls stop doing it,0
4803,orders always delayed and doesnt arrive on time,0
4804,i ordered and paid by using touch and go ewallet and it shown it had refunded to my lazada wallet but the amount of my lazada wallet is still remain unchanged and my tng ewallet also didn t receive any refund and also my tng ewallet,0
4805,ok,0
4806,it was confusing and irritating i was just letting my sister use my phone for her to access her account and when i login to mine it keeps saying null or suspicious acctivity and it wont let me collect mu vouchers and redeem my lazcoins this app was great but this problem is making me hate it,0
4807,this app was really helpful esp this pandemic keep it up and still can order even your an ofw,1

4809,shut up with the frikin adds and when i try to watch some thing online it just sends me hear and shut up with your hiden adds just why would you hide an add so shut up you bastard,0
4810,it s a great app i can buy all the things that i need and i want,1
4811,lazada is full of scam and con businesess happened to me twice first when i bought a wrist watch which the seller sent me the watch not as advertised and second was the worst i ordered a bluetooth earphone and paid good money but instead i received a junk touch pen from the seller this is a reminder to those who decide to use lazada if you don t want to get conned better stay away from lazada i only have bad experience with lazada i prefer not oto give even a single star to them,0
4812,low price but late delivery,1
4813,the entire company is a joke they don t deliver on time and their couriers are rude too,0
4814,good product prices and easy to use,1
4815,the best among the online platforms in terms of pricing and service,0
4816,more discount po sana pa thank you,1
4817,cleo the automated customer service does not connect me to a live agent so i can t follow up why my paid order s status is not changing from packed by seller from this app is giving me anxiety that i might lose my paid purchase,0
4818,i like this app but after sometime it doesnt load properly i cant purchase anymore,0
4819,i ve been a customer since this platform launched but they ve never been fair to me shopee is very generous and extended me all the diffferent services i m happy to pay shopee interest because they value me unlike lazada that is so close handed,0

4825,is this a scam i purchase airgun last night using bdo credit card and transaction is successfull after the payment the item still in to pay status and will be expire soon the problem is i already paid the item but status still to pay very disgusting,0
4826,apps is very convenient to use,1
4827,after selecting the item buyer should be able to enlarge and view the image this is possible in other ecommerce platforms but not shopee,0
4828,easy but yet secure,1

4833,sometime i buy tiok fake item but totally service is good,1
4834,very reliable e commerce platform and lots of options for affordable and excellent products just need to improve only on the search options hopefully could also include number of returns most number of sales and to not include other unnecessary products which is not related to the product searched,1
4835,i tried ordering an item after placing the order the app says the item is packed and ready to ship this created an entry under both to ship and to receive that s confusing has it shipped out or not then days later the seller tells me the item will be available in two days huh i thought it was already packed now the seller told me the item has shipped but the entries under to ship and to receive haven t changed both refer to the same item i can t track my package either weird,0
4836,loading so slow,1
4837,did have problems occasionally but lazada handle the party concerned effectively and efficiently i tried others still prefer lazada,1
4838,keep bombarding me with messages and promotions despite me opting out no respect to my choice or privacy have uninstalled,0
4839,easy to use voucher n tq for the voucher good info to follows,1
4840,rarely seen such a bad app infested with nonsensical advertising constant hints that user xy has just bought this thais may fall for it search results usually have nothing to do with what you are looking for filter possibility also an absolute joke,0
4841,good app momo pay love,1
4842,many items reasonable pricing but during the sale i encountered cancellation of my orders by the seller after the orders were accepted and payment made giving reasons like undeliverable area hdb in singapore undeliverable unbelievable another reason is out of stock but the order was accepted in the first instance overall still a good e commerce site despite these shortcomings hence the stars rather than,0
4843,good speed n stable,1
4844,so far so good when i am using the app shopee was introduced to me by a colleague who is also a frequent shopper of shopee now shopee became my frequent app when i need to buy stuffs online purchasing is easy customer service is good however the description on some sellers listing isn t clear not detail enough and un understandable hope that shopee can help to clear these with the sellers one more thing on the vouchers which sometimes will get me confused on where to get,0
4845,i love this app so much,0
4846,loved the app though ild like for the wishlist button to be more visable on the app it was this tiny thing hidden away imo,1

4871,convenient and smooth transaction,1
4872,easy and excellent,1
4873,though peppered with loads of funny sellers spurious offers cheap branded goods fakes and copycats flagged as authentic lazada platform still one of the most reliable and safe place for on line shopping just need to be careful and smart platform often guilty of playing it s customers with excuses of connection error etc to prevent access to coin exchange and managed product offers with smart manipulative discounted deals and free shipping,1
4874,it helps me to buy quality and good products very useful,1
4875,some seller are responsible and responsive so far only one case the seller sent a wrong item to me took sometime to return due to the delivery qexpess was not very friendly and they don t communicate with me when are they coming to pick up the item when changed delivery service to another they were good only need one time and they listen carefully,1
4876,no online shopping app very convenient to use legit items nasa lazada yan madami din sila pa vouchers free shipping kaya naman sulit talaga sa lazada mabilis din ang shipping and pag dating naman sa return refund sobra bilis din kaya no hassle kapag lazada gamit mo s pag online shopping basta online shopping nasa lazada yan thank you lazada more sulit and budol deals ngayong year so excited mkapg check out ng mga essential goods from lazmall thank you lazada,1

4931,recent tasteless ad depicting mocking disable person presenter was very rude with unimaginable vulgarity languages,0
4932,this is so much lovely and nice shop sobrang gaganda ng quality,1
4933,absolutely horrible the search system is abysmal and intentionally provides misleading search results to advertise more totally unrelated products the design is disgustingly lurid and sometimes pornographic item listings are advertised through the horrible “flash sale” system where they deceive customers into thinking that listings have large discounts when in fact they are a mere us – off lastly they ve made this app into a dating app with many posting half naked pictures,0
4934,your chatbot doesn t know when to redirect to a live agent you have a bug in the voucher inconsistent with the voucher application before check out it will show me free shipping then when i m about to check out free shipping voucher is not applied i ve checked the t cs of the voucher and i met the requirement why would it even show me it s applicable in my cart as i select thr items i m about to check out then have it not work when i m about to pay seems like a scam,0
4935,seems like there is a bug with the new app i am a lazrewards member with a vip status with the new app i can t find my lazrewards,0
4936,seriously this app is so annoying it always pops up whenever i m browsing the internet that i can t even touch my screen please improve your way of advertising it makes me want to uninstall this app and forget about it,0

4983,now this app product more expensive if compare with recently,1
4984,worst rebate system they will offer you cash backs after purchase or cash ins and rebates that are totally unusable the app is so confusing cant find a way to use your earned rebates and cashbacks unlike shopee you can use them right away after checkout also earned coins are also useless maybe you should use shopee to see how you are far behind from them in terms of reward system,0
4985,i cancelled an order and it says order cancelled and refunded but i haven t received my money back it s been more than days yet the amount i have paid hasn t returned yet,0
4986,good but pls reduce shipping price,1

5016,on time delivery and good quality products,1
5017,scam by lazada to not let buyer withdraw their money from their wallet it keeps on saying failed verification is it really failed or intention by lazada not to process the verification and withdrawal to force you to consume your cash on their platform,0
5018,no star kahapon pa ko di makalog in may mga order aq iniinty di pala pedi blck str pang blackstr rate nito,0

5038,very convenient app it helps me a lot especially for a mom like me,1
5039,so many ads it s so annoying,0
5040,going to uninstall this after i received my items my card seems to be used for unauthorized purchase after shopping at shoppee,0
5041,lazada is now having an offer where you will invite your friends to get php however no matter how many friends you will invite to help you reach the php target you won t reach it as lazada decreases the amount of money that will be added to your acc in each successfull invites this is a scam please be ware also i have an order that is still in transit for weeks already but don t have an option to cancel my order i should rate you guys no star if possible,0
5042,very good app you can find many stuffs easily,1
5043,why i cant click confirmed to my shipping address it seems like my product will not be shipping out if i didnt click it helppp,1
5044,giving this star rating right now due to having lack of clear answer and help as to withdrawing funds from my lazada wallet i can t be fully verified at the moment coz my id s aren t on their list so my funds on thier wallet intended to pay for bills are stucked i can t pay nor withdraw my money and my desperation is that i might incurr huge interest on my loan dues coz lazada wallet is holding my funds they re not giving any clear answers except that they can only report it,0

5052,good app highly recommended for fast delivery good products and hassle free as they act easily on items for complaints and returns and refunds thank you lazada,1
5053,shipping is horrible even before quarantine delivery takes too long,0

5056,annoying popping up on everything i click on browser,0
5057,i don t have any experience yet but i m hoping i will receive good products from lazada,1

5065,i ordered at lazada but all items was defective waste of time to order here,0
5066,big brand discount plus site discount save a lot,1
5067,interface is hard to use cleo is not useful because of the limited automated system and its hard to access or find the official way of contacting a live agent perhaps if you adjust more options available or displayed righthand in cleo including talk with live agent perhaps it would be easier to handle customer concerns,1
5068,i ordered products using lazada coins and all of a sudden they are all cancelled this is kind of scam i have evidences already reported to dti,0
5069,i m very satisfied this online shopping application is very good their service is much better than shopee i m just telling the truth don t be mad at me,1
5070,we the customers should be the one to pick which courier we want to deliever our package because some courier don t respond when asked and don t deliver in exact shipping adress,1

5072,annoying notification banner everytime i unlock my phone,0
5073,cannot add anything to cart since days ago missing out on everything that is on logged me out and i cannot log back in had to reset my password using samsung note,0
5074,ok i got scammed times i trust this too many time and now i give up there are some seller that take pictures of the real products and put it in the description while they are sending fake products and also you should confirm their products like send some videos with the products cause they change the name of the products everytime i hate this i m just gonna install shoppee if it s always like this,0
5075,good and easy ways to order,1
5076,my order has been resheduled times already estimated delivery date was jun it was reschedule to june then june then you are not aligned withe your tagline mas mabilis this issue has already been raised to your helpdesk they have created a ticket but seems useless no action has been taken yet ganun pa rin ang issue walang improvement na return to seller na nmn yung order ko no call or text from the rider hindi din sumasagot sa txt or tawag,0
5077,smooth to use,1
5078,the constant amount of pop up ads that direct me here is very inconvenient and very alarming i m afraid this will not convince me to download your app nor will it convince me to shop frankly i m very annoyed that your phone web browser advertisements work this way let me browse sites in peace without the pop ups please you won t lose that much money from it i guarantee you,0

5091,best online shop for me you can always find affordable legit items that saves you from having to buy expensive stuffs,1
5092,lazada has the worse logistics in the universe they only keep extending the get by date and so called speed up the process for you but in fact nothing has changed you won t get any updates on ur parcel either ways not to mention it s even called priority delivery absolutely baffling rather use shopee instead,0

5101,kindly be informed to all buyers please don t sign up for lazada wallet or using lazada wallet to purchase you may not be able to withdraw the amount in your lazada wallet after order cancellation,0

5104,so far so good no defective item has been delivered to me,1
5105,participated in shopee event and lost first time user voucher referred by my friend n ver happy to get referral code of just as i wanted to use it its gone because of stupid app does not recognised first time purchase vs event participation that required you to pay spoke to live chat team but does not understand problem let alone help to resolve the usual way to shut us up can t do much because system showed u hv made first purchase see n reach our policy n regulations,0
5106,not all negative comments will be published on their product section they will filter it i bought a bad product and i give my honest review about that but got rejected ironically all my positive comments were published if seller don t have stock they can simply cancel it without informing me unless i login to this apps to track the status they refund it in form of lazada voucher which has expired date on it which force me to buy another product before the expired date,0
5107,so far so good but there is always room for improvement keep it up,1

5131,i received my orders quite late but it is affordable,0
5132,lazada “swallowed” redmart now redmart users are forced to use lazada app to order items however lazada app is poorly designed to handle redmart orders it’s difficult to use confusing and missing many functions also my “lists” somehow became incomplete or partially copied to lazada site now i could not find many of my saved items i don’t understand why lazada would rush to move redmart users to lazada app when it is not ready to replace redmart’s much better app,0
5133,thanks for easy shopping,1
5134,good market,1
5135,the product and seller both reliable,1
5136,same issue with another reviewer here all images are too big and unable to view or scroll on the page fix your app,0
5137,why the items i wanted cannot be sent to the buying cart as if you pre selected a few products to be checkout why no details on the weight of each packaging why you advertise voucher but cannot be claimed when checkout is this just gimmicks,0
5138,i like it and don t like bc my phone is broken and when i buy stuff it s almost not like the picture,1
5139,i hate the feeling ab spamming advertisement so much,0
5140,enjoy shopping w lazada it so cool no hassle thanks lazada,1

5154,convenient to use you can use free shipping voucher and cashback at the same time i really love this app,1
5155,this app is very usable because you dont have to buy in store and this app will deliver to your house,1
5156,very hard to navigate compared to other shopping apps and makes it hard for customers to ask for help relatively limited choices in some products and search results aren t as accurate or optimizable ads also suck and credit is harder to redeem customer service is hard to get hold of and refunds don t give you your full money back ads for crwppy games everywhere is also horrible,0
5157,kha tot,1

5172,its so easy to use and you can buy anything you want,1
5173,items were shipped without confirmation by the buyer suggest putting restrictions like utilizing otps prior to check out in this case minors or kids can not order freely without consent from parents or guardians,0
5174,cancelled order for wrong reason tried chatting their customer service only to be told that courier thought of the address as wrong address when in fact they re across the street from where i live bad service bad experience never try this app,0
5175,i tried adding my address but it keeps telling me to put letters please fix it,0
5176,i ordered pd had delivered returned because front panel was bent and knobs broken sent pictures even before any other correspondence the provider made neg remarks said i had to engage in verbal dispute for a refund the returned item pictures and explanation should have been enough and did not warrent their verbal abuse i have since changed my phone number i no longer want to order from lazada and do not recommend buying or using anything connected with lazada,0

5196,the notifications were getting annoying yes i could turn it off in preferences but it was default on the number of messages is ridiculous uninstalled,0
5197,lazada is the worst platform i ever met for online purchase they don t bother to offer help for the buyer and expected buyer to contact the seller ourselves if any wrong when problems come then you will know how good this service provide is,0
5198,this is my first time to order in lazada i try to order a mystery box if it s a true i ordered june,1
5199,discount and cashback voucher cant be use at the same time good job on your update you should focus on the coins they dont have any use on your app,0

5226,please remove the “add all to cart” button it makes customers place duplicate orders accidentally plus it is such a hassle to move everything back to the wish list just because something is in the wish list doesn’t mean the customer wants to buy everything on it right away thank you very much,1

5262,so far service is ok and keep improving,1
5263,not a friendly app their user interface is confusing coins are limited to other shops only so as cashback higher shipping rate than other shopping platform i paid twice for shipping fee from ordering an item and returning it won t be using it again never ever,0
5264,nice and fast,1
5265,im ver satisfied much better than the other online shopping app,1
5266,was gonna rate star but because the deliverer was so rude to me he didnt even had any politeness when talking,1
5267,if you buy a product and the item is fake they never support customer it is too bad there are alot of duplicate product sellers,0
5268,wonderful app easy to use,1
5269,i always need to put the payment by cash on delivery but it keeps on getting back into cash payment fix this app,0
5270,poor accuracy most of the time not getting items wrong items arrive help desk is good for nothing since weeks i m waiting for refund only automated response as communications,0
5271,i like the fact that the buyers are rest assured because most sellers that are in lazmall are legit but the others are not i can label them as scam because when the product arrived its different from the picture its a different variation instead of telling the buyer that the product is out of stock they just send a wrong one and i am just annoyed and disappointed yes return is possible but what about the overseas sellers it would take too long and i would just let it pass than just return it,0
5272,great app to shop on the go,1
5273,awesome shopping experience good offers wide range of products prompt delivery loved it,1
5274,the item search is so dumb showing different items from what you were looking for,0
5275,why are your ads for lazada so bad i don t want to install it again but every ad i get is about lazada stop me showing your ads some of them don t even relate to what your service is its online shopping some ads i get are a video of something interesting and it cuts of to a security reminder not online shopping or the about horoscopes or using my fingerprint to guess my future your ads are misleading and are very tricky to hit the close button because you try to paste a fake one bad ads,0
5276,was so disgusted or even discourage of lazada in ordering items probably jewelries the seller are liars inducing us to get order in saying genuine saudi gold but the price is very low unbelievably i hope that lazada personnel will look at it and stopped them to do fraudulent acts here of not telling the truth,1
5277,what happened with lazada wallet seems like it s not working anymore it used to be great when it s working now all of my money can t be used anymore,0
5278,ive already tried thid app and it was good its fast delivery thats what i like,1
5279,easy and convenient,1
5280,does not work,0
5281,fast shipping and many item legit and they have priority order u can get your order as soon as possible and they garanty and discount for delaying the priority shipping very,1

5297,worst delivery service it took long time to deliver the order they are not taking the business seriously,0
5298,great app to be used comparable to orher shopping app payment mode is not restricted on just credit card payment,0
5299,good app to sell or buy anything,1
5300,st time to use the app and it s user friendly,1
5301,for those who does not need it it s a very annoying and frustratingly creative ad that keeps on popping up jezz can i ban an app for myself,0
5302,effective sya so i continue to use this product,1
5303,saw the time free gift for new users when i chk out for it i was told not entitled to it coz only for first time chk out u guys didnt state clearly i m definitely new user pls define clearly in bold sentence that its meant for first chk out i clicked for it after rd purchase coz i had the impression i can click for new user free gift as i had nvr click before dont like this kinda loophole i felt cheated n deprived of my rights whatever pls kindly dont gimme standard reply with no substance,0
5304,bad refund policy be careful if you need to refund make sure they refund you first then return product i advise to use shopee instead better shopping experience at shopee buy products with confidence at shopee as you can reject paying for the products if it is bad but not for lazada in this pro consumers era i have the worst experience with lazada,0
5305,convenient but long,1
5306,quick easy to post items for sales chat with buyers seller on the go,1
5307,i m enjoying the convenience of buying things i want to buy especially at this pandemic time where you can t go out they also have big sales offer and free shipping making you save more for transport expenses you only have to be mindful checking reviews to avoid waste of money,1
5308,a lot of things from tiny to large scales for shopping and a payment is very comfortable,1
5309,it was my first time to use the app to purchase a retro gaming console that i ve been droolling over since almost years now found a good deal in lazada made the purchase however i received a wrong item i purchased a gaming console and i received an armpit whitening cream peeler the return guidelines were also not useful and the fact that you have to go to a return hub to actually return the wrong item is a hassle the reason why people use the app is for their convenience but if you have to return an item you will have to fill up a form pray that it will push thru go to the return hub and wish that you ve done everything correctly it was very frustrating since this purchase of mine is supposed to be a gift for myself after i spend my time working tirelessly for the whole year and i was disapointed i will never use recommend this app again after dealing with this return steps,0

5326,please add myanmar as soon as possible there are alot of myanmar who wants to use this app as their online shopping app thanks,1
5327,the service is good but i kinda looking for a feature i suggest lazada should create a feature where customer can express their suggestion to the platform on what product they are looking for that are not available in lazada examples are vintage clothes movie inspired outfits and many items that has a market demand but don t have a supply sellers might have an interest or inspiration on producing this products if they aware that it has a potential i m graduating btw available for hiring,1

5466,super affordable and fast delivery thanks lazada,1
5467,inspite of the ridiculous and falsely advertised product by sellers and receiving other than the actual items we customers are often left with disappointment and anger but because lazada is able to step in and take charge even though its not their fault is still commendable,1
5468,unlike shopee pay once you cash in on lazada wallet you can t transfer the money back to any of your bank or cash wallet accounts and you can only spend that money on lazada one of the ways lazada gets you to shop more is they will offer you either p or p discount depending on what you buy if you pay via lazada wallet but you have to cash in the original price once you pay for the item the p deducted from your original cash in is left on your lazada wallet promting you to buy again,0
5469,need more filters for scammer seller and item checking and verification,1
5470,good service but please help all the concerns thank you,1

5539,good at fulfilling deliveries but is hardheaded when it comes to using a scam courier named ninja van although that courier is widely known for delays and worst disappearance of parcels altogether while it is lazada s right to use ninja van they should not force buyers to shoulder the risks and inconveniences with that shady courier buyers should be given the option to choose a reliable and trusted courier,0
5540,quality is always good and the all seller are very kind,1
5541,here are some of my suggestions on how to enhance customer experience in using the app enabling messaging delivery men via the app and via sms in the voucher tab it will be better to have a tab where all your followed stores vouchers are available to access your dispute committee is very slow this is based from my experience with an open refund dispute have a server where all complaints are to be compiled monitor your sellers review ection some sellers do fake reviews,1
5542,thanks for this app you help me a lot for my motorcycle parts or anything i need thank you again lazada no,1

5705,great app just be wise when u check out always check for reviews and store ratings,1
5706,shopping online with lazada is very convenient especially during this pandemic no need to go to the malls to do window shopping instead download the app on your device and browse visit stores and go over with reviews of other buyers so you can have ideas what items the best to buy i find less time consumed and less effort because deliveries are made directly to your address also you can buy items at reasonable and affordable prices good coupons and vouchers from stores and free shipping,1
5707,good quality save money and satay safe🥰,1
5708,images took a long time to load sometimes it doesn t load at all i hope there will be an absolute optimization in the future make all this sluggish behavior resolve i was expecting for a lite version of this so it will be minimal and data saver as well,0

5809,it was great though i m almost completely satisfied with their services but there s a problem in packing and delivering the products because it was so slow and the delivery rider s are having a hard time to find those addresses because the address that lazada was only wanting to know to us is our province barangay street etc but not a house number a block and a lot of the house to be delivered properly,1

5826,i mistakenly placed an order and cancelled it after realizing that it s not really the item i thought of and tracking it that it s not been packed but it was still packaged and sent no problem i paid and received the item but of used my advice is that items should be well describe especially where the picture can not fully show what it is example case of phone etc,1
5827,everything good except website reads english website but no english,1

5841,no available cashback voucher anymore i contacted their customer service first agent told me that they will fix the issue but they didn t so i contacted them again and the second agent answered that the cashback is no longer available since november and will be replaced by coins but coins is so useless you buy a product for pesos you can cashback redeem it for pesos but with coins you can only redeem pesos the difference is a lot bring back the cashback,0

6034,delivery is fast sure although i dont like having my order cancelled wo my consent then expect me to be ok with days refund for my debit card payment i couldve waited for the item but they decided to just cancel it and now i cant reorder order the item i want because i have to wait for more than month for my refund debit card as payment option shouldnt be this difficult lazada customers have this option because of convenience,1

6128,bad experience hard to find products slow shipping,0
6129,too many ads redirecting to your app,0
6130,why does a shopping app need to reward coins and have games,1
6131,i do not use this app often but i find it useful for purchasing items you can not find at a nearby market but one thing i don t like though is that i ordered an item that says it will be delivered in two days but it was actually delivered to me five days after please do not put the days on the delivery if it is not acurrate thank you,1
6132,mas ok sa shopee order delayed for days delivery attempt failed courier did not contact me ako na nag contact kay courier wala reply uuwi dapat ako nung aug kaso delayed and order so nag hintay ako kinabukasan the wholeday ako nag abang ng delivery delayed parin hindi guaranteed and ontime delivery dito useless help chat,0
6133,is good but i think more people will like it more if u guys let selling pet like scorpion and more people will install so u will get more money,1
6134,very reliable and hassle free,1
6135,too much ads it s so annoying when an ad suddenly pops up my screen and when i try to close it it suddenly directs me to the app itself so frustrating if people wanna buy then they will search and buy not force people into opening the app unnecessarily i recommend shopping at beautymnl for beauty products healthy diet goods milks tea etc because even if you order from different stores they only charge shipping fee of pesos although this is only around ncr i think or shoppee,0
6136,lazada is the top online shopping for me but store scams a lot to happen idk i didn t experience it yet can you add more process ui like all of my orders that still just packed i think having a tab for packed items would be good and those still unpacked will be easier to cancel,1
6137,turned off notifications for promo messages still gets them unsubscribed to newsletter gets spammed in email,0
6138,good dilivery of order nice package,1
6139,excellent service and product easy to use,1

6144,i ve been trying to access this app since the sale and there s this image or another tab that always pop up i have a strong internet connection i can even watch a movie or shop in shopee but this app always crash i tried updating it and uninstall then install,0
6145,so far most products i received are as per the pictures shown just have to check the seller s rating and reviews before buying,0
6146,i won facebook live arnold s pick but there s still no message coming from lazada and i don t know how to reach you about claiming the prize i m thinking if it s legit but the one winner who was announced first before me already claimed her prize and thinking why i still haven t i hope you notice this coz i don t know anymore hahaha i m actually planning to give my prize as a gift to my mother thank you in advance god bless you all po,0
6147,whenever i get into a website it directs me here forcing me to download this app every single random site i been on with ads though i dont click on ads it just takes me here randomly out of nowhere,0

6155,very humble and good items thank you lazada,1
6156,received a fake product and the seller says it is real and i can t return the product plus i can t refund for getting a fake product lazada is definitely a bad company,0
6157,very convenient and wide variety of items,1
6158,of all my orders are always saying failed delivery even though my adress was my exact location i just hate it,0
6159,good quality items,1
6160,i can find things here that is not available or hard to find in the market accessibility and affordability is the key,1

6162,ever since lazada was bought over by alibaba they have been allowing more and more china scammers to sell fake products on their platform when you get scammed they will side with the seller and not give you refund users please be more careful when buying from lazada,0
6163,easy n convenient tq lazada,1

6173,return refund option should be enabled after customer clicking the item received option if we report an issue the customer care don t have option to send email and can t arrange call back as per lazada they r very limited options to provide customer support the timelines to address issues are longer and no visibility to end customer,0

6220,purchased an expensive product from lazada two days later after payment went out it’s still pending no notification sent i had to check the system followed up with customer service providing them with proof of purchase and transfer now they say they need two more days to look into the problem but they don’t work weekends so when you take someone’s money then don’t process the transaction then seemingly can’t even find the transaction then make the customer wait more it’s not just unprofessional it’s untrustworthy as of today you’ve taken my money and refuse to process the transaction even with proof of payment that’s called fraud,0
6221,your great justl ower your price,1
6222,good app great discount confusing ux at times,1
6223,so far my orders from lazada are delivered to me in good conditions and satisfied with orders i always read comments regarding the products reviews really helps especially for a first timers like me,1

6248,this app is good but the only problem is its so slow,1
6249,lazada is a good online shop but the thing is there are things shopee can do better like when i asked for a delayed delivery because i have money issues shopee immediately cooperated with me and gave the courier my instructions however when i took the customer service in lazada and asked the same they didn t really cooperated with me they just said to reject the order when it comes to my doorstep and have to order again but i don t want that cuz i have to wait for weeks again for it,1
6250,i didn t order nor open this up for more than months yet i m receiving calls that i ordered something yesterday i don t even share my phone and account nor let others use it please fix the issues regarding to this matter we open website then suddenly an ad pop up and auto buy something we didn t know,0

6313,low price a lot of choice good,1
6314,i find it convenient using this app only wish some of the return policies were more flexible or at least made clear while purchasing a product especially electronic items we should be given an option of change of mind if not suited to our purposes which should be accepted by lazada in most cases its not accepted as a reason to return the item,1

6324,what a bad experience support staff syifaa cut me off the chat halfway because she don t know how to resolve the matter as seller they make it confusing when buyer submits refund request so u end up losing your item and have to pay for refund their support staff will be polite and say sorry but tell u they can t help at all edit apr i got ended by agent named iqbal abruptly again not sure why they have all these rude cs who can t solve any problems at all,0
6325,great application convenient online purchases,1
6326,i’ve been using the app for a while and use it to get hungarian sausages because i like the ones in lazada compared to the grocery stores i made an order the other day and when i finished it perhaps glitched and i saw the page swipe times for some reason i only pressed once but then when i checked it made my order multiple times for the same item all were separate so i paid new delivery fees on each order which was half of the total cost the sight is also quite slow when processing orders and instructions are difficult to follow as this sight has multiple sellers with their own guides to handling customers which isn’t too convenient but not impossible to straighten things out i didn’t resolve my problem as it was overall still worth it but peso delivery fee x does amount to a lot when it should have been just from the sight so still quite a bit to figure out,0
6327,fast delivery and items are legit,1
6328,hay,1
6329,please fix your app put all details in the checkout and shipping when i get back after some time and forgotten the size of the shoes i bought there is no option to see the shoe size and the color,1

6712,this lazada app now contains explicit pornographic and inappropriate feeds this is an example of false sense of everything this app can be used as an example to teach people how buyers are subconsciously lured with thumbnails and fraction of a second clip however gravity of the effects to kids will be unbearable,0
6713,less buggy and more filter options than shopee s application but the user interface is packed with waaay too much information really ought to be streamlined i get dizzy sometimes just looking at it especially when riding on vehicles during my commute,1

6919,good quality and all items not fake,1
6920,its convinient but not sure bout delivery charge i just notice that every item now had a pesos charge this might a negative outlook to lazada,1
6921,i was hoping even i cash in there is an option that you ctan withdraw back your money so far this app had changed part of my everyday doing and i am so happy for this kind of opportunity given to me,1
6922,almost everything under the sky,0

6926,thank you my order came safe and sound ehehe,1
6927,great shopping app lazada is the best,1
6928,good for online shopping,1
6929,fake promotions lure people to put money into wallet when requesting to withdraw takes more than a month although their policy to days no updates on the progress instead customer have to follow up on the progress when contacted the stupid customer service full of promise when we asks on the progess but all is a lies even their ceo magnus ekbom don t even care no response at all from the ceo no wonder all the staffs attitude are as such treat customer like a beggar no more lazada,0
6930,does not let you look at the product unless the app is first downloaded into your phone,0
6931,stop popping up for effing sake it s inconvenient and very irritating most of the time stop bugging me about your ads,0
6932,give us option to mute in app sound,0
6933,app works well most of the time has some ui issue that needs addressing,0
6934,this app is great it helps me to find my needs and also the customer service is very accommodating thank you and godbless,1
6935,tired to open selected variants always loading continuously without opening at all initially want to shop eventually become really lazy to shop here,0
6936,always have ads even i already downloaded it,0
6937,rd time trying to register the lazpay and failed again i don t know how the system works i m a long time buyer and use lazada frequently than shopee perhaps a big sign to stop shopping here spaylater got no issue at all,0
6938,the lazada service is the worst ever online shopping experience broken items wrong products delays slow app full of glitches and scammer stores and the laziest customer service ever and the most stupid dispute team you can have and get stuck with all liars and can t depend on not recommending shopping through unless you want to kiss your money goodbye and get headaches and unnecessary stress,0
6939,only thing i can say is there shouldn t have a capacity of how many to like i personally like scrolling through the page and look at products that are intriguing so instead of putting it on my cart i can just like it and i can just find it if i would want to order it,1
6940,just make sure that all seller s item is at its best and assist every customer who encounters problem with the items purchased,1
6941,its good to shop and order on lazada,1
6942,i give star to lazada because when i order with free shiping and then i see the payment there are still shiping please fix it if it has no free shiping just type no free shiping do not be a liar,0

6949,it was my first time to order online and i choose lazada and i m glad that what i have seen online is what i exactly get in actual thank u lazada for making life easier as this pandemic we can t go out to do shopping as often,1
6950,for me the shipping of my order is so much money i spend my time to buy and after that when the delivery boy is here the shipping is so much i did not believe that,0
6951,fast and easy,1
6952,nice app very manageable,1
6953,they always ask sorry for the inconvenience that happen,1
6954,this app is so annoying their ad is almost everywhere im watching anime and this keep on popping like pimples im so pissed off,0
6955,good overall but layout is somewhat confusing,1
6956,good quality and service,1
6957,great place to shop,1
6958,new app is not user friendly as compared to the previous in the previous app once my account is opened you can transact to lazada easily this new app is quite complicated,1
6959,love this app easy to use and order online,1
6960,it s okay for me to do online shopping at lazada,1
6961,ads always leading me on this app it is so annoying i wont download this if you always advertise it on my face,0
6962,very good its a big help for us especially the big dscounts,1
6963,its depend upon delivery as good quality and branded,1
6964,i didn t like this i can t read indonesian and its not in english so gonna delete it this is my second review over here i re instaled this and i order many things it s a good app but again for me to order something is like to touch the moon it should be in english option as in malysia plz consider this and give the foreigners more ease thanks regards gave starts at the moment but if i find this english option then starts its my rd review with the same problem,1
6965,when you are using uc browser and and when u press all the links in uc browser all the links seems to connect lazada why its that,0
6966,lazada is good it s like online divisoria it s just that lazada should take precautions with the seller side regarding lots of complaints while we as a buyer should also take extra precautions with our purchase and take full responsibility with it hoping lazada can improve the quality control of the platform good job,1
6967,i only buy mystery box to get chance to win but i never been have that chance,1
6968,app unable to get through the shipping process please kindly fix the bugs,0
6969,poor delivery partnership the delivery partner didn t text or even call me that time on delivery day and they say delivery failed and in fact i almost waited the whole day to recieve the item and i highly need it i waited for almost weeks and i m so disappointed this is my first time to encounter this kind of issue please resolve this lazada as soon as possible because your delivery partner are not doing their job properly they re so unprofessional,0
6970,silently consuming gb of ram nope thanks,0
6971,always satisfied thankyou lazada,1
6972,easy and saves time and effort,1
6973,very recommended app i love lazada,1
6974,please keep your ads away from my phone it s annoying as f,0
6975,slow in delivery and the item sometimes is damage,0
6976,thank you lazada more vouchers,1
6977,ok service is very good and very happy shopping with lazada,1
6978,not even a single star if that s allowed i have php fund in my lazada wallet that i cannot get due to the restrictions on my account i requested for assistance since the last week of january it s mid september now my case kept on closing and they are giving me the same exact resolution which ia too far from what was my request i gave too much patience on this but this time i ve had enough aside from having fake products and missing deliveries you also have the worst customer service,0
6979,put the real price or at least the price range of the items in one posting it s wasting time and misleading you click on it expecting that the price of the posted item is what is indicated until you put it in your cart and the price is different stop playing lazada it doesn t help you get loyal customers or a purchase pros you can filter by specific item,1
6980,too much ads so annoying,0
6981,status of order didn t update for wks after i alrdy rec d items by the time the status updates i m no longer allowed to submit a review for a seller that s clearly misleading shoppers i ll never buy anything from lazada s mall until this is fixed this kind of terrible ux and seller experience never happens with amazon and why would you reply to me in a language i ve never used are you trying to be clever or are you really that dense,0
6982,nice products but expensive shipment fees,1
6983,please have a complete list of municipalities in surigao del norte having problem ordering for door to door cause of your incomplete list can t even have my correct home address due to this,1
6984,well and good keep up the good service,1
6985,i order in this app always and they always exceed my expectation stars,1
6986,nice may the icon logo is still showing notifs even though i have already opened and view them,1
6987,i put an order with a wrong address then i cancel order thought hv to wait for one day for refund but i received the refund in the next sec super good experience,1
6988,this my first time to rate lazada first time to order items i wish i get phone and no issue to use,1
6989,be very careful when you use this platform many unethical sellers some sellers make you wait for a few weeks without telling you that they are not sending the products some will include some defective ones when you order many pieces and it s difficult to ask for refund since it s not exactly damaged even at check out sometimes the platform doesn t allow you to use certain promos or discounts which you agreed with sellers,0
6990,i honestly prefer shopee than lazada shopee interface is way better than lazada shopee has more vouchers offered than lazada i just need to download lazada because i cant find the item in shopee lazada needs to improve,1
6991,app works well gives incentives to use it and makes it much easier to receive messages and notifications,1
6992,the ux is really bad lots of icon button link dont work load properly mostly just blank or shows unaccessible web version of the app already checked with my internet connection wifi which is just fine it s super annoying i could barely open any icon or take vouchers and the photos of the item doesn t load even though i refresh many times clear cache uninstalled install doesn t work is it because my phone s older version of os or is it just the app,0
6993,they have forced the migration of redmart app to lazada s which is completely out of that league full of offers low end screen junk and low capabilities,0
6994,nothing compares lazada when it comes to online selling complete line of products thanks a lot,1
6995,need to be upgraded the voucher and free shipping voucher,1
6996,keep popping up as ads annoying app,0
6997,most of the items good for buying and price is okay,1
6998,they have many good deals on gadgets their delivery is also on schedule,1
6999,i recently updated and cannot login into my account i hope you can fix this because lots of my items are on shipping i need the tracking number hope to solve my problems as soon as possible,0
7000,easy to order reliable,1
7001,intrusive ads always bring me here here s my reply,0
7002,i really love this app you can find whatever you want to buy online,1
7003,generally it s all okey to buy here although sometimes there are seller that mislead the buyer of their products just to have a sales i already have bought plenty items in lazada but only there times that i was di satisfied with the seller those delivery crew assigned to my place are excellent and already knows me cause meet plenty times hope you kick out those misleading post for sale here in lazada more power and more sales,1

7008,great experience convience of buying and shopping though shipping charge sometimes are too high,1
7009,i wanted to buy some broducts but there was no option of my country bangladesh so i can t buy those things,0
7010,i expected this is a friendly app but i hate the thing that always pop up that i should or may be must to share about the product that i searched for because of it i can t focus and interup review to the item,0
7011,the priority delivery isn t even guaranteed to arrive by the said date,0
7012,can you please add a translation other languages there a re a lot of foreigners checking this app yet it is frustrating that we do not understand the categories because it is in vietnamese we have to open each category just to see if it is the one we are looking for,0
7013,online system number one the lazda now is easy life for me one click only is there no huzzle thanks lazada,1
7014,lazada is a recomended online shopping fast delivery and a lot of free shipping vouchers and discounts thanks lazada more power,1
7015,checkout to payment page sometimes force closed and most importantly the review page sucks especially when you completing your product review typing so long and while uploading photos and videos it crashed super frustrating and never fixed since the first day i use this app besides too much unrelated products on sales don t just focus on money and livestream we buy product based on reviews as well i am hardworking person and dun kind trying but i am unwilling to review coz troublesome,0
7016,veery usefull app,1
7017,this app is trying too hard to get users to use it imagine auto downloading itself with its ads that s not how you re gonna surpass shoppee and other online shopping apps and franchise,0
7018,i love lazada,1
7019,cant make the payment even with lazada wallet,0
7020,high priced product but low priced shipping fee,1
7021,very well when it comes on format still waiting my orders up to this date,1
7022,bruhhh im so annoyed i cant read manga on google peacefully because this app keeps on showing adds you can t even cancel the add because when you cancelled it it goes to this app same with just touching that add almost every minutes bruhhhhh i just want to read peacefully,0
7023,ordered thermopro thermo hygrometers which was supposed to come as a set of an lcd monitor and thermometer received only the lcd screen asked for a refund or for the remaining item to be sent since then lazada and its team has just brushed off the matter took my money rejected my refund request and marked my case as resolved when tried to reach i was just pushed back and forth and no solution was given they advised me to repeat a refund request but has locked this feature on my side,0
7024,ok i m overall quite satisfied with the app not perfect but still a good experience however i suggest that laz shouldn t allow seller to put cheap unrelated item as one of the option under the main item they re trying to sell because it serves like a clickbait and is false advertising,1
7025,love this platform the delivery fee is transparent and notification is given in timely manner especially where the item is from overseas,1
7026,i love lazada for shopping all products i ordered are all in good conditions and also they delivered too fast thanks lazada,1

7034,can t install update and everytime i checkout it gives me an error and empties my cart after so i can t put my order it s really annoying and very hassle,1
7035,just be ready if your products is unilaterally cancelled dibatalkan sepihak without confirmation so you will lost your vouchers and discount of the product still not worth five stars and need much more improvement,0
7036,easy to use and buy things online,1
7037,easy to use and low price,1
7038,some image size can t be seen in gallery or folders when product rating can t view the last digit credit card used for the payment only installment credit card last digit is viewable copy message in chat should be common long press or something,0

7113,why limited people to bookmark favorite items set to unlimited we can refer our bookmarks many improvements needed,1
7114,good at all free shipping voucher and so many promo,1
7115,lots of vouchers and delivery is fast although there are times that it is confusing they should put a range of all the prices when there are different types of products in one posting sometimes i thought the price was the same regardless of the size or type and i get frustrated when i realize that the one i m eyeing for is actually much more expensive than my initial expectation and budget just because of the price posted which is always the cheapest from the selection,1
7116,excellent ever but sometimes the seller is not good specially on the product that you ordered 🤔 but overall is great,1

7130,trying to unsubscribe from the letters but the button beings me here installed the app verified my acc but whatever i press it send me back to verification and no chance to unsubscribe from everydays letter please unsubscribe me,0
7131,the app kept spamming even though i had disabled all notifications in the app,0
7132,app or web site won t let me order from the us it keeps putting thai shipping address as billing address it worked before but i m not sure if it was the update they just did if you read my review you will see i said i updated the app,1

7135,shopping is easier and hassle free,1
7136,great web portal for online purchases the layout is commendable there are significant discounts from time to time delivery is usually prompt,1
7137,great app i love it,1
7138,this app is getting worse it s not user friendly it was a user friendly app before too much messages the help desk also useless furthermore there is no human customer service all feedbacks sent were ignored no wonder everyone is going to shopee to shop online shopee much more user friendly coins can be used to redeem anything u like lazada coins can select till exchange but can t proceed further the claim button is useless cannot work so coins deducted but nothing received,0
7139,trustable site but variety is limited,0
7140,nice and easy instructions,1
7141,it crashed the phone,0
7142,the quality and the safety of order is good,1
7143,for a company as successful and well funded as lazada the app has many small difficulties and issues that add up to a clunky and inferior feel i would expect this type of app for a startup company,1
7144,very satisfied services,1
7145,so far okay naman exp ko sa pag order online with lazada lahat ng inorder ko dumating on time and the items are all good when i received it keep it up lazada,1

7153,remove lazada pop up in chrome or i will never dowload this app forever,0
7154,i am surprised by the customer chat support capability they told me to wait since the issue unable to pay via lazada wallet will be escalated and after an hour working great very happy with this app but i have a question is there any other country from which your products are from like thailand indonesia south korea vietnam etc as i see it all products all comes from either philippines or china is there any way to include products from other countries,1

7158,i love sendo,1
7159,i really love the return refund policy by lazada i have bad experience that the competitor shopxx seller cancelled my order and refund into shopeepay without any discussion made in lazada those seller claim that packaging damage is normal for wearing item not normal acceptable item and ask buyer to accept but if buyer don t the return refund will automatically approved which means if buyer send back the damaged packaging wearing item back to seller seller have to accept it too very fair,1

7232,i luv use this app while having a backup money when i use it through my smart shopper it help me for lifetime,1
7233,this app is good and easy to use but the worst things in this app are the couriers are not responsible and the deliveries are to long i was waits for a keychain weeks long how worst it,1
7234,shopping on shopee is a hit and miss for some things for the price though it s cheap and affordable since now you can even buy groceries on shopee i add another and with the partial lockdown in place until june i can practically order stuff for my mom s marketing online even buyimg coverture chocolate for baking on shopee eh thanks much shopee nahh give you all,0

7241,make shopping easier many selection to choose,1
7242,i would like to file a report with lazada regarding a missing product you will allegedly blame the delivery boy and withhold his pay even though it is not their fault,0
7243,i am more loving lazada now then it was before less scammers product wise more quality refund of purchase is very convenient,1
7244,convenient at very generous sellers godbless more power,1
7245,my account was restricted to force me to only use cash on delivery and they won’t let me use my debit or credit cards to pay for items when i contacted customer service they said i had fraudulent charges on my credit card and asked me to call my bank which my bank insisted i did t have any fraudulent activity on my account so when i reached back out to lazada customer service they requested i send pictures of the front and back of my credit card to show proof it’s mine and with my name and then demanded i provide an email from my bank stating i do t have any fraudulent activity on my account it seems to me that someone in lazada customer service or their payment center is forcing customers to provide credit card info so they can use stolen credit card data to commit fraud or sell that credit card data this is a terrible company and everyone should stay away from them if possible,0
7246,its so nice online shop but they slowed shipping,1
7247,love it was great,1
7248,budol budol app if you are not mindful you ll not notice that the prices change before proceeding with payment so some shipping fees are free but when you check out you willbe charged of shipping fee the app keeps on crashing,0

7256,got scammed cause seller gave me wrong item only have full amount refund or return item back to him but he is a scammer so if i return i lose both the dollars and the item there is no proper help support or money refund choice,0
7257,smooth free from glitches,1
7258,ill give star to lazada for now as a seller which is now way better to shopee the agent and services are both good keep up lazada,1
7259,lazada is really useful they take actions more seriously than shopee comparing lazada with shopee lazada is waaay better and shopee is really left behind this app offers better customer service and the surveys they email users are really convenient for them to know the users opinion and how it will be better even most of the shipping fee in this app is better and the delivery is also fast and better,1
7260,lazada support illegal software many illegal software there and never mind when report it so i edit from to if have negative i will do,0

7613,i had a bad experience with lazada been ordering a few items like celfone yes its cheap but knowing oppo is a good brand i ordered the price is oo i was so disappointed even the ear rubber something that help to get debris os a mess i was not able to used at all the items are all bogust,1
7614,annoying attempts to make people download the apps it s almost stalkerish i don t want to download the app yet websites are always taking me back to this playstore page when i want to check if lazada has anything i need from its website it doesn t let me view the items i want to look at but takes me back to this page very annoying,0
7615,convenience at fingertips,1
7616,this app always auto deleting,0
7617,thank you for the free shipping of my return took a while but now i received my refund already thank you kinda a long wait but the process was easy,1
7618,so far all my orders are good and worth the price thanks,1
7619,nice looking user interface but the delivery addresses section is terrible the information requested is not in the natural order for thailand customers worse still the descriptions of the individual address lines to be input are almost all wrong i entered my home address in the way the app demanded but for the final postage label it was displayed in a completely different order which will confuse the courier and probably delay delivery,0
7620,need to stop redirecting everything to push people to download this app i prefer mobile web thank you its just annoying and i ended up never even wanting to search in your mobile web because it kept pushing me for download your app learn from shopee or blibli they are better in this,1
7621,ok do,1
7622,great app and helpful vouchers,1
7623,lazada has a wider array of consumer goods and lots of discounts,1
7624,easy to use and more vouchers to choose,1
7625,so far my experience is pleasant it is very easy to purchase items on this platform i have refunded twice returned item once very easy too,1
7626,doesn t let me order so annoying,0
7627,very fast shipping and stackable vouchers,1
7628,stop redirecting me to this page,0
7629,most recommended online store,1
7630,great shopping anytime,1
7631,fast no lagging during sales,1
7632,you have improved but your prices can t beat shopee s pricing and delivery charges you need better products and honest sellers who are not out to try and fleece buyers with additional shipping charges thats why i rather shop at shopee than lazada but you are improving and hopefully this is a clear sign that you take feedback seriously,1
7633,vouchers and free shipping processes are very tedious too many promos pop ups etc but not all are useful or can be applied sometimes you get it sometimes you don t only cheaper if you can apply these vouchers or promos,0
7634,to all shopee users out there please be mindful of those people working at shopee in singapore they limited the accounts for nothing and asked for a photo id to verify if u are the owner next whn u fulfill that they asked for the photos of the items u received then they start asking for your bank account isnt that suppose to be confidental due to the personal protection act why is this person by the name of kelly keep asking me for that shopee is not the cheapest platform u can fin,0
7635,excellent very useful service must recommend for everyone,1
7636,i have not yet experience but im sure that good and adorable,1
7637,such a good apps for those who like home shoppings but really need to view the rating of product before you purchase it,1
7638,the heck with this pop up ads its really annoying,0
7639,annoying ads turn up on the phone every minute even when lazada is turned off app hijacks your phone and renders it useless everyone should delete this app and use browser only lazada is a disgrace for hijacking your phone with ads every minute interrupting anything you do on the phone i tried to report lazada to google to have the lazada app removed from playstore since lazada s app constitutes harassment by hijacking the phone,0
7640,this is a legit seller this is my second time for their products,1
7641,please,0
7642,fast delivery and affordable products,1
7643,spamming ads in all sites sucks,0

7650,so far never had a bad experience from my various lazada purchases esp using my lazada wallet no hassles encountered even on instances of returns refunds and order cancellation,1
7651,many functions but many of them such as games coins are not core functions therefore the performance is very average for this app,0
7652,i m so disappointed on this app it takes longer my item received almost weeks before i checked out until right now i didn t receive,0
7653,products are easy to view,1
7654,garbage company i used to be able to order items and recieve them but now it s about and when the courier simply won t deliver there is practically nothing you can do i end up initiating chargebacks with my credit card company because lazada is incompetent and you can t even complain that you didn t receive your item because they will respond so sorry please send item back for refund,0
7655,good n fast service very reliable too,1
7656,unstable and poor system i have been reporting issues for months like couldn t collect coins after completing playing the games but seems like no one is looking into the matters at all now even worst that i can t even make payment for my purchases how to even buy from lazada then,0
7657,been using lazada for a years already at okey nmn minsan lng matagal dumating ang order pro items are good,1
7658,if needed fast can contact dealer and is fast delivery when request,1
7659,they sell you the best for the cheapest price kudos to lazada keep up the good works,1
7660,good apps for ordering a more items you want thanks lazada,1
7661,lazada is my best anyone items i love it thats why i have a lot order merry christmass lazada,1
7662,the only reason i buy from redmart is cold storage and fair price doesn t have as goof a selection redmart handling starting to suck and i start to wonder why i continue,0
7663,i hope lazada will read this last i use lazada was about month ago just bcoz i did nt find the item i looking for in shopee i hope u guys do like wut shopee does hold the payment for us customer until we push the order received wut if i buy a g shock worth rm then the seller pun rm kid watch inside the box n the payment is released who can i blame if such thing happen so lazada hear our voice till then i only gonna buy from shopee,0

7666,quite good but just should be free shipping fee then it will be perfect with stars,1
7667,this apps keep popup everytime u watch movie in the gomovies and other website,0
7668,sometimes the order is super delayed,1
7669,works well on a normal day but during sale gives multipke errors,0
7670,i am starting to see a pattern here each time when there is a special sale day with huge discounts my account is being blocked for security reasons which prevents me to benefit from the offers and each time it turns out there is nothing wrong with my account is this lazada s method to cap the number of orders can t they handle it or do they sell a limited number of the special offers on those days either way it is frustrating and annoying for customers,0
7671,excellent except for the delivery man sometimes they re not kind,1
7672,best way to shop without having the need to leave the house and the luxury of time to choose from wide choices among online stores and multiple options of payment schemes love this app,1
7673,im happy for this app amazing deals,1
7674,the delivery time slot is always run out and yet i still have to pay delivery charges the web today have some errors afew times while i am purchasing this really upsetting me because i have to redo it again,0
7675,i cant open to ship session i order raincoat and now its pieces i dont know what item i checked out,0
7676,good convenient many products to choose from,1
7677,lazada offered more cheaper then the other and very easy payments too,1

7681,this is my most preferred onlinr shopping app legit hassle free and always on fast deliver,1
7682,please improve your help center they are not replying any massage,0
7683,the app itselft has potential the negatives side of this is that some that sells items on lazada are not keeping track of the quantity they have in stock they shoukd do something about it i guess to make it fast and easy for buyers and to have less time wasted shopping well thats what online shopping is all about to make shopping fast and less hassle,1
7684,good service easy and simple this app,1
7685,the app is great no need to go to mall for shopping but hopefully more improvements like item delivered is exactly what is in the picture and make all item display in store are more detailed like you captured a picture in the item which is truely the item inside the box and also if it is ok to you make the item in one delivere like exam if i buy item which is in the same store but different item let say for intance mobile phone and headset make it in one delivery only,1

7739,the only problem is the courier once na d nila macontact un reciever d nila pinupuntahan sa bahay at imark nila as failed due to customer is not reachable this is a cod and door to door not thru phone i think so if they cant reach customer phone for some reason i think its neccessary na puntahan prin nila un bahay this is base on my experience nasa bahay lng aq at natutulog dhil night shift ang work ko thank you and more power,1

7913,sometimes i get good shop seller but sometimes i get a very nasty seller,1
7914,lazada has the worst customer service ever the app does not make your life easier in fact with my recent experience with them i wondered why it had to be that difficult so in every purchase you can leave notes for everyone to see mine was very simple it was for them to deliver on a later date they all ignored that and the customer support agents were not helpful it was also very difficult to get word from these agents also it seems they have no direct say on their courier s process,0

7919,really disappointed in one iterm i purchased its was totally from what s was described initially,1
7920,too many information would appreciate if the layout be more simple,0
7921,lazada has several awful incomplete non sensical product descriptions and its often almost impossible to verify select product variants for example a product image could show three differently sized colored boxes but the product descriptions wont include box sizes measurements material types or color shades you might in fact just be receiving one out of three boxes but you wont know which size the product selector is also often just as useless with ambiguously written choices,0
7922,hassle free more orders more fun enjoy vouchers free shipping and others offer keep it up lazada i love lazada thank you lazada,1
7923,good lazada offer hoping for a greater discount or voucher god bless,1

7943,notication for time delivering showing on phone and also notice delivery to your with message phone,1
7944,the search function is really strict need exact spelling and sometimes even that won t match because of how sellers put the product names i always find myself going back to shopee because of the more robust search,0
7945,why am i getting redirected to your app i dont even use it i cant just search or click links for something without getting redirected here,0
7946,minutes ago i still haven t received the code on my number please fix it,0
7947,ok very nice,1
7948,good as i expected,1
7949,game most of the time stucks and sometimes can get the reward although we follow instruction,1
7950,i love lazada very easy to order they have cod lots of free shipping n discounts n sales many variable items to choose from for me its the best,1
7951,its very good app easy to use and reliable,1
7952,it has a good interface easy to access i can buy stuffs that i needed without going out this is very effiecient for me as a full time mom with a toddler i m enjoying their promos that s why i ve become attentive to their lazlives every sale season,1
7953,i was satisfied with lazada my orders had arrived properly and intact,1
7954,i like to buy things at lazada buy only cheap item its because some of my friends told me they buy from item lazada and get different item i also just recently order a watch at lazada but the one i received does not look the same like the one i purchased since i dont have time for a refund i just use the watch until now but in the future i dont think i will buy anything from lazada anymore especially items like smartphones or other expensive things i just hope that the company that sell the item could tell us the buyer if the item we ordered is no longer available instead of changing them with different item without telling the buyers as a customer i feel cheated because i did not get what i pay for even if it was not expensive but my money still has been deductef from my account hopefuly lazada can fix this trouble,1
7955,i love this my husband and daughter and inlaws are there and my cousins so ai love this app god bless you it s fun easy and a beautiful way to get out items,1
7956,good until recently i cant placed order in sale for over hours couldnt placed the order and some of the vouchers discounts will be gone it always says something went wrong with the check out then retry again to no avail please fix this,1
7957,rat ok,1
7958,the user interface of this application is very messy the refund resolution by shopee is very tedious and they are very careless sellers are allowed to dispute refund just to bargain with buyer even though the goods are defect goods shoppee customer service resolved in favour of seller very bad experience,0
7959,very useful and helpful,1
7960,place another order on may via bank transfer may received a sms say that the payment not verified and order been cancelled check the app indicated the order is pending shipment wth updated i goes to the xxxx contact us page tired both app and web page fill in and upload the photo but cant seems to find the send submit button what browser should i use,0
7961,enjoy shopping here nice riders good quality of products,1
7962,i think the interface needs to improvements maybe use different color background on words to highlight their function i m getting used to lazada app by now i hope all sellers put in effort to describe their product correctly i had to make a hard educated guess on what they are describing their products i love the cashback and the freshiping i can buy more here than anywhere else with the same quality,1
7963,always more times verygood a liitle not good always verygood deliver and products,1
7964,annoyed with the ads come from website and open the app,0
7965,very practical and easy to use app im addicted to shopping here,1
7966,lazada it was so good to use and very updating on your order for delivery in your destination highly recommended,1
7967,past deliveries and good transaction to the seller so far,1
7968,so far no issue some are cheaper than other online market but i ve serious doubt abt authenticity of some branded products that is selling at fraction of the original price is this allowed,0
7969,latest update makes lazada slower that voice recognition feature is extremely unnecessary what were you thinking that feature is already built on keyboard putting such useless feature won t make you more money so please focus on optimization,0

7984,the worst experience a shopping app can give you bad ux ui bad support service,0
7985,dec collected member points during and want to redeem gifts however not able to checkout opened a case thru customer service live agent told me thr is suspicious activities associated with my account and then marked my issue as solved w o solving the issue i reopened the case and requested customer service for details dec no details provided told me the same thing then marked the case as solved again my issue is unresolved,0

8108,very quick for service easy to deal with,1
8109,good application and fast delivery,1
8110,after firsr attempt by delivery man the delivery man immediately writes bad comment and never make second or third attempt this is not proffessional and lack of proper communication with the courier delivery partner or man handling customers goods,0
8111,good experience with the user interface easy to use and track my deliveries,0
8112,your ads are annoying,0
8113,easy access affordable prices quality products,1
8114,i m very dissappointed to my order it was tag as delivered but no item arrived to requested delivery address how can lazada check on your logistic partner delivery we paid the item on line so mean it was a scam how lazada act on this matter,0
8115,this is commercial app must say stupid when i want see again my products this app is hidden anything,0
8116,amazing experience so far,0
8117,very useful app to purchase online,1
8118,if only sort by popularity feature works properly,1
8119,i am new customer with lazada and it was very disappointing experience this complaint is for the courier lex their couriers have bad attitude and poor service first order was cancelled due to customer refused to accept delivery and i never even got a notifications that the courier is on its way the second time i order the courier ran out of time which im ok with that and the courier handed the parcel to another courier name nelson evangelista and lazada notified me that customer refused,0
8121,one electronic vendor priced same item at different price at the same page someone s sleeping wakeup la,1
8122,shopping made easy great savings and hassle free,1
8123,i love thiss app,1

8130,nice app for shopping online,1
8131,fast delivery so far i have no problem with the items delivered thanks lazada,1
8132,all else are good happy birthday lazada,1
8133,always my go to online store very affordable and very much safe and secure they always accomodate my concerns and never let some bogus sellers do harm on their buyers,1
8134,good app but a lot of fake brands so need to be aware when you buy,1
8135,at first the app were good to use and legit until i can avail lazpay after using this app for a long time i liked it because it was approved very quickly not until after i paid the first amount my lazpay suddenly grayed out without any reason i have never failed to pay or missed a payment more than one week before returning then the same thing happened again grayed out without any reason and worst any vouchers either cant be used just because i created a new account sudd i was banned,0
8136,i made a purchase for a very good price on but sadly your the delivery didn t even tried to contact me and attempt to deliver the product but instead he tagged it as deliver failed saying that i requested but didn t he didn t even tried to reach me your courier service s cks,0
8137,overall they give a satisfactory service only thing i find lacking is the ability of lazada to weed out unscrupulous sellers there are some defective products that are still sold wrong product shipped actual product delivered is not the same as in the picture or misleading product description tricks with pricing and fraudulent claims of some sellers they should give more free shipping stubs offer with no minimum purchase to encourage more purchases from us,1
8138,too many items on surface dashboard not user friendly too confusing,0
8139,legit app you just need patience to scroll to find good deals,1
8140,the cheapest platform you could ever find in the whole world probably your whole life,1
8141,why are you not letting us talk to an agent how are you allowed to operate without customer service invest in your customer service we need real people not bots if you can t do chats at least a reachable email support,0
8142,very user friendly will be good if can link to other countries shopee for more suppliers who can ship overseas,0
8143,i love lazada compare to others online shopping available but i am shock whenever i open my lazada app i cant open it in my device but when i used other device can open what is the problem help me to fix it i done uninstall and reinstall i cleaned up cached everything i did but sad to say cant open it,1
8144,fast and reliable,1
8145,it was easy to use application,1
8146,after a month of shopping online in thailand have to conclude that lazada is probably the best and customer oriented app here,1
8147,very affordable products are here you just have to search for the right stores and sellers the delivery was also fast and they often deliver even weekends unlike other shopping apps,1
8148,bad and liar,0
8149,great service delivering good items on time,1
8150,bad instant delivery map accuracy better use shopper address as main delivery destination put on map make it hard since accuracy not good and map point not show accuracy to the shopper address and hard to correcting it really troubling and many time make me choose other online shopping to buy the same items this is my personal opinion bsaed on my personal experience using instant delivery other things is good,0
8151,i always hope not to receive any damage everytime i shop for now so far so good thanks,1
8152,love you all,1
8153,cannot use the search after the update,0
8154,good when it comes to vouchers and free shipping i really enjoy window shopping with lazada because of that and to see how much you can buy the item,1
8155,very good experience so far most orders came very early very good delivery system,1
8156,iya om i yi,1
8157,i have no complains on deliveries but the items i receive seldom looks as advertised it s disappointing esp those coming in from china,1

8463,it s a good app for online selling but has lots of bugs and it s pretty annoying one things that i think is a bug is that i saw orders one was in the to receive and the other was in the to ship i panicked cuz i thought the item i order was double and then i frickin check that they were the just the same in the order number please fix this since it can cause confusion to your users,1
8464,i used to love using lazada app compared to other online shopping apps but it is very inconvenient when it comes to deletion and withdrawal process taking longer time to delete account and withdrawal money from wallet to bank account i think i will just give up using this app,0

8472,messy not well layouted difficult to sort out,0
8473,it s good once one is familiar with its interface which to me wasn t to difficult to catch hold of always remember to check reviews before purchasing the item,1
8474,it s horrible i thought i am the only one who is suffering with this kind of problems when i read some of the reviews there are lots of people who are having the same problems i fed up of chating with computerised reply if the people behind back of customer s service feels that you are already annoyed that s the time they chat with you,0
8475,all orders were served good so far keep it up,1
8476,very satisfied about thier service to the customer,1
8477,i never experienced any problem with this app is so easy to use and i like how it looks the transaction here is way faster than other e commerce even if i ordered overseas it will just took days unlike to other app that i used it usually took a month which is so annoyingg plus the free shipping is so accurate and i hope they won t change it just like the another app,1
8478,i see lazada everywhere like everywhere i just want to stop seeing your ads and hearing your jingle rather than making me re install they make me wanna stay away,0
8479,good shopping app with lots of good deals still have some fraudulent sellers my mum bought a toy but got scotch tape instead hope shopee helps to resolve,0
8480,so lag and bloated it stops my music player,0
8481,lazada works like a turle it delivery time takes years i was happy to order but the time of delivery tooks so and the delivery fee is so expensive shoppe is better,0
8482,easy to compare price and time safe,1
8483,cos i ve received some unnecessary users i believe these features are necessary esp for online shopping without these it s a turn off,0
8484,the app has a silly filter feature any time i choose to sort items in order ascending then nothing happen alk items still in chaos status,0
8485,the app is great it has an ok price but the problem is that when i try to proceed the payment it says you should pick a payment method and i tried to pick a method but the loading is really long and we couldn t proceed i think theres a bug a problem with the loading can you please fix it thanks,0
8486,your way of advertising your app is too annoying im just using chrome and with a single tap click it will open the app its disturbing already i want to find a way to block this app from popping up again,0
8487,im not satisfied with the items that gave to me delay na nga ang delivery ganito lang pla ang matatanggap ko,0
8488,i give five star because they dilivered with care and the items i received still in good condition,1

8496,very very good,1
8497,horrendous customer service experience with an almost impossible to reach customer service representative,0
8498,too few vouchers and you can t even use them using voucher s on this app is so hard no matter what the price of your purchase it won t apply at all that s why i prefer the other shopping platform it s so easy to use vouchers there i only use this app for cheap purchases high purchase on this app has no discount not even free shipping what a waste,0
8499,ok,1
8500,reliable but you need to be rational in using it,1
8501,much better than shopee the free shipping vouchers could be used without any issues and the shipping fees are much cheaper than shopee but can you purchase less ads on free movie sites sometimes your ads pop up everywhere,1
8502,what i hate is that cashback points don t last it expires very quickly and vouchers can only be used on sale and not to mention your ads are very annoying you don t have to redirect me to your app everytime,0
8503,quite a long time i didn t shopping in this apps try my luck this time despite of bad reviews before look more updated than before,1
8504,please end your partnership with xde as one of your delivery logistics they bring only bad reviews to shop due to their poor delivery service and bring about bad customer experience check the reviews online about xde or ximex and end your partnership with them,0
8505,so easy and fast to order,1
8506,thanks lazada for easy shopping,1
8507,this app allows sellers to scam people into buying will not use this platform anymore shame on you google for allowing such app to be available for download,0
8508,the thing i hate about lazada is that they don t even attempt to deliver your order and just cancel it without sufficient reason my order was cancelled due to delivery driver running out of delivery time i understand that this is a busy season but shouldn t they be making time i m just upset since i waited for it for days when it s supposed to be delivered on less than a week please improve your deliver service,0

8722,why you still considered all those scammers here when you buy an item here they will deliver you a small pouch instead beware,0

8761,i love this shopping app now many cashback and free shipping vouchers shipment is also very fast only takes days,1
8762,i don t recommend this online shopping app because lazada keeps changing the schedule when will my package arrive and they have slow delivery service the app is also very difficult to use and when using a voucher it doesn t automatically apply sometimes when you re buying a product and want to view the seller its hard to look for the profile and it s very confusing if you want a online shopping app i suggest downloading shopee it s much easier to use and very fast delivery,0
8763,i feel safe shopping here and secure at the same time for my purchases,1
8764,very convenient to shop,1
8765,orders are always delivered on the quoted day date,1
8766,fast delivery and good quality quite addictive,1
8767,i hate its notifications it is so annoying i tried turning off all its notification and tried freezing the app but it still has that persistent app banner that keeps on appearing everytime i open my screen it s like an ad that keeps on spamming i don t know what to turn off anymore until i decided to finally get rid of the app itself hah your marketing strategy is not effective to me because it only makes me annoyed and not order at all bye lazada,0
8768,ok but tracking detail improve,1
8769,i ve been using this app for many years i just experience this year that there s still a seller scammer although they re convinient to accept orders but they send the wrong item i bought an item and it s worth of k plus but the return is just a something like a toy watch and i paid it through gcash and t s kind of disgusting coz why lazada let the scammer join their company and the seller didn t reply immediately i hope lazada will take actions in this kind of issues,0
8770,best shopping experience,1
8771,delivery was fast however copying files onto this seagate tb portable disk is very much slower than copying onto my existing seagate tb and seagate tb portable disk i was told that computer experts that copying files onto an old disk will become slower as the disk becomes older but this tb is newly bought unless seagate sends an old or refurbished disk,0
8772,lazada never failed me every time i ordered item recommended to my family and friends,1
8773,verry satisfied to buy some stuff thanks lazada,1
8774,couriers are not good most of the time they dont coordinate with client they just make a report of unsuccessfull delivery with out even calling the customer they should call us before returning the item to the sender,0

8970,as soon as you purchase the product the algorithm does not allow you to purchase the same product at the same price it immediately gives you the impression that the commodity demand is high and will not bring you to the same priced page even if you search via search engine one example is finding the same item at a low price when you search in google but does not allow you to open the same in the app,0

9170,i feel secure using this app and platform i love their refund guarantee the only thing i hate about this company is the nd and rd wave delivery because i cannot wait for the entire day for it to arrive they should schedule it the next day they are very efficient in terms of logistics but not so precise and accurate in their app alert sometimes the courier arrives before the notification in their app and it s a hassle,1

9180,literally comparing it to other app cash on delivery is difficult you will have difficulty in finding specific itema unrelated items appear even with search filter not time efficient you can t find important details in one page if not careful enough u might forget looking at ratings because it s hidden it s crazy how all items are discounted yet it s the original price many more,0
9181,horrible delivery and customer service customer rep is also very condescending and unhelpful,0

9196,add paypal as one of the payment methods,0
9197,lazada should remove fake sellers from its platform otherwise users more will jump over to its competitor sh pee i had placed orders but product never arrived what irks me most is that reason given by lazada wrong address other orders immediately before and after all arrived to same address no problem these are not app related problems but since lazada platform is app based this is the most appropriate avenue to voice grievance here,1
9198,very convinient and fast delivery,1
9199,lazada was good when shipping with j t express but if ninja hyaaa oh my god duga,1
9200,good and easy to use,0

9235,your incessant shopee shopee shopee shopee ads have annoyed me into returning to one star review an app i actually was ambivalent towards to begin with congratulations i m not using this app again,0
9236,the app itself is good the only problem i have with this is with your delivery partner ninja van twice i had the contents of my parcel stolen by the employees of this delivery service this delivery service is apparently very notorious with delivering tampered and or empty parcels as per my workmates who had experienced the same thing countless of times this case should be taken seriously,0
9237,stop making ad for this app its annoying,0
9238,i always used lazada to purchase anything i like and i need previously everything just fine i love it and i am pretty sure i can give u stars but after i updated my apps hard for me to make payment i try all payments method but it said i have no internet data bufavor what should i do,1
9239,good apps more discount thx,1

9831,this app is the worst i would give it stars if possible most pages are entirely in thai and impossible to translate inside the app the most upsetting part is that if i attempt to browse lazada on my phone it sends me to the app store to download it i do most of my online shopping from my phone and i do quite a bit looks like i ll be giving my business to other online stores who don t force their terrible and useless apps down your throat,0
9832,i like lazada but theirs alot of not emportant ads its consume time for choosing ur product,1
9833,the shipping fees are quite expensive i understand the situation due to tariff increase so i ll stop opening this all for a while,0
9834,this is my first time to order from lazada hope it will be delivered soon thank you sir ma am,1

9875,more a lot choice than other shopping online some more cheaper but some olso more expensive,0
9876,i would suggest if you could improve the ui to a more simple minimalist design so the app can be easily used also upon searching a particular item i would have to scroll down to find the most sold item with highest rates instead of having it placed on top so it can be seen immediately hope this can be considered as an improvement of the app so far it s all good,1
9877,lazada should be renamed lazydah orders use to arrive quickly these days you are taking your sweet time,0
9878,lazada apps are so good they re easy to use especially my mom she s happy because when she has something or needs to buy the lazada apps she orders she won t come out and my mom is still safe especially since there s a pandemic now thank you lazada,1

9903,for me based on my experience lazada is one of the best online shopping that i try i can buy our needs in lowest price because of the vouchers and discount when it comes to delivery it also fast lex ph is the best for return and refund it also one of the biggest flex because lazada costumer service is very patient and very fast to solve the costumer s question and problems lazada had a lazmall stores where you can buy a authentic and original products at lowest price kaya sulit,1
9904,nice and easy to use really a great help hope to continue their good service,1
9905,app works well quite streamlined,1
9906,update has made it less user friendly,1
9907,this platform is not safe fraud no email or there office can be revealed wanted speak to their manager also restricted items bought in this platform not given proper check when you order in bundle there is item is missing less product sent in when refer back to their customer service agent onnlive chat you still cant cancel you still need to receive the item in order to cancel and when you report again you need to wait another month and so for refund only upon investigation,0
9908,delivery fast and good,1
9909,circuit breaker very very slow delivery have to cancel orders many companies cannot have too many staff in warehouse to pack order not enough manpower if u can wait for many weeks then go ahead,0
9910,hay,1
9911,to much adds for this app it s f annoying,0
9912,i hope everything that is bought here is worth it because sometimes i see comments that are not satisfied with what they buy because they expect the purchase to be good tell them right away what the items are and don t expect the ones posted like that,1
9913,the search system is as smooth as diamond grade sandpaper,0
9914,why always unstabled when i wanted to open your app,0
9915,items are often poorly described and there seems no option to contact the seller for more details just found out depending where in the same province you like the item shipped it can be double the fee,0
9916,fast and easy,1
9917,rat tot,1
9918,ok very easy to shop,1

9928,greater than ever,1
9929,easy to shop,1
9930,good,0
9931,this is beautiful and free shipping,1
9932,what makes it good is because of a fast delivery but then the fee is more expensive than the other shop apps at times im hesitating to buy from here because i e though you buy product in an expensive and larger amount they hardly give you discounts in some ways it not so friendly app for a first timer it somehow confusing and hassle to use so i guess some consumers costumers will rather switch to other shop app because of this concern i believe there is a room for independent,1
9933,i will never order again in lazada it is like a trap you order something it on a local store then waited for more than weeks for your order to be delivered and it leaves you no choice because it is not allowing you to cancel it a big mistake to use this app what a waste of time and money,0
9934,had your app installed but you guys keep having your ad as a pop up ad to so many sites that it got annoying i had to remove your app and leave this review wish there was a zerp stars review,0

9945,useless chat support,0
9946,your official lazada app is retardedly slow and also a massive resource hog i can t count how many would be purchase i had to cancel because i got annoyed by your garbage waste of an app you should fire all of your present app developers and web framework designers and replace it with competent ones for a large company such as yourselves you should be very very veeeeeery ashamed,0

10036,my shopping experience in shopee is getting better i like the notification of the delivery schedule before purchase the ability to communicate with the sellers and making payment is easy through credit card any cancellation or refund is also easy and so far i am happy with the experience searching for competitive pricings and product comparison is also easy it is useful for sellers to upload many pictures of their products to allow buyers to see and fully understand the products well,0

10069,amazing delivery is fast,0
10070,bad apps i bought something but cancelled by lazada due to their technical issue then i cannot redeem the voucher used by the cancelled order what a bad apps,0
10071,terrible customer service their system is usually down or broken or some other excuse their warehouse manager geraldine is extremely rude and hangs up on you when you request her name or to talk to her superior because she can t solve your problem customer service agents give you empty promises they can t deliver on regarding cancellations or refunds overall you re better off using another shopping app,0
10072,great budget saver,1
10073,this is a top notch fun online shopping mobile app one of legend absolutely,1
10074,this is app are helpful,1
10075,good to buy things from lazada,1
10076,thank you so much for honoring my request to have a lazada apps,1
10077,nice,1
10078,the ads are everywhere but still i do like this app,0
10079,unfortunate i bought a sale counterfeit goods seller selling counterfeit items with original ads and more put their sale counterfeit items on sale first page yet shopee didnt do anything i think aliexpress or qoo still better hope shopee settle my issue soon,0
10080,this app does not follow the screen rotation lock settings on the device it will display various pages in different orientations forcing the user to rotate the device constantly,0
10081,easy to sell,1
10082,awesome the other apps blocked my location even though i already have many pirchase before for cod but only lazada offers me a cod i will now uninstall the other apps,1
10083,many items are not paid by cash on delivery so what would i do if i don t have any credit card or gcash don t shop,0
10084,easy to shop i love the disc and vouchers,1
10085,fast delivery and food products,1
10086,love this app always give free rebate and coupon,1
10087,app is quite laggy but it does what it suppose to do one thing i dislike about the app or lazada system in general is that seller can report your review eventhough you bought the item and lazada can track it but they still remove the buyers review this means that seller can report all the poor reviews and keep only the good one making the item seems better than it actually is i recommend buyers be extra careful before purchasing hopefully lazada do some investigation before making decisions,0
10088,great app for online buying,1
10089,don t really like the new interface for redmart the previous standalone app was more user friendly,0
10090,i dont like this app this ads just appear from nowhere,0
10091,review doesn t matter you are going to use the app if you order from lazada that being said it has to many ads and that makes the navigation messy also they push junk products in the search you really need to review everything you purchase i have also had numerous bad reviews taken down for no reason there are great products on here just be careful,0
10092,simply the best on line shopping and trust worthy,1
10093,a lot of good and quick when shopping,1
10094,hassle free shopping experience since nagpandemic napakahirap nang mamili sa malls and having lazada on our phones is just a big help and mas madaming discounts sa app than at the malls bonus pa yung convenience at no sweat sa pagbabrowse nang iba t ibang options to get the best deal lazada shopping at home delivery at your doorstep highly recommended,1
10095,it keep saying unusual detected my account is year old and lately this always happen and i cant buy anything because of this unusual activity detected,0

10105,fast and secure delivery,1
10106,please make it more user friendly like another marketplace apps lazada must do random review seller s products avoid fake products using original name in their title and also another products that may harm people and or don t meet our country health regulation please more consisten with your promotion in social media like instagram for example lazada was announced bicycle flash sale in their instagram but due to the date there s no bicycle in their flash sale,0

10115,am so done keep getting popup redirects and too much advertising spam was a lazmall customer but no more,0
10116,one of the worst ecommerce platform app overall experience to buy from this app is like a con and cheating app promotion vouchers are so difficult to used as if not willing to give the discount lazada appis total rubbish in comparison with shopee or prestomall many of times whatever discount or free shipping voucher selected will not applies upon payment thus the final price is more expensive,0
10117,very poor customer service getting a refund is hard as stone and then you ll wait for nothing i dint recommend this app this app is trash,0
10118,the app is easy to use and everything you want is in lazada,1
10119,other than not being able to receive a welcome gift because i made a purchase before redeeming you should change the policy for how you determine your new customers it is still good app to use,0
10120,too slow while opening other are ok,1
10121,this is my second times but i just realize that if i ordered so many thing from different vendors the shipping doesn t free and has a lot of rules to get it free shipping well i am not understand this rules,1
10122,great app and fast delivery thanks lazada,1
10123,i can t seem to remove items from my cart i don t know if its a bug but the app works fine,1
10124,all images r truncated can t fit in one screen can t even scroll to view the full image can t view the variable options to select too the discount coupon are too volantile period of use is too short getting a coupon is already difficult but on top of that one might not be able to use it cause its fully claimed come on in this aspect qoo is better if you manage to get a coupon it is definitely reserved for your use and the validity is longer not hrs or d only,0
10125,i can at least find items needed that i can purchase since in my city not much available in local stores delivery expensive and take very long to arrive,1

10188,mostly im very satisfied with the products and delivery system f ailures are just minimal its tolerable,1
10189,very nice apps ang very easy to use and see all my needs here thank you lazada 🥰,1
10190,good and vomfortable shopping online,1
10191,good in buying no need to go outside,1
10192,please remove flash express from your courier options or at least allow us customers to not choose them update added more stars after initial overreaction bec my good experience with the app outnumber the bad one but the option to choose couriers should be implemented,1
10193,so far so good the service is excellent keep up the good work 🥰,1
10194,the app is working fine but hopefully they will have an option to report a listing that contains fraud violate lazada policy collect payment not in the option of lazada,1
10195,i want to see the product rating by stars i only see stars looks like you removed the option to look for star rating to protect the sellers please bring it back the old version were you can look for product by star rating and i also noticed some fake feedback they re five star but the buyer are complaining it should be star i think the sellers edited it please fix i don t want to get scam money doesn t come from trees,0
10196,first orders ko dumating the rest laging intercepted as in lahat na sasabihin sorry this item will no longer be delivered heck lazada okay nmn tayo sa simula ahh do something i already talk to the seller they ve been packing my order so why is it always not able to come,0
10197,having error after updating app not able to load games page,0
10198,not as good as the old lazada the delivery fees are now separated per stores so if you buy items from different stores the delivery fees also adds up same as the vouchers being separated per stores i miss the days where the lazada gives voucher that can be applied to all items monthly together with the sale event now you need to deep browse to find voucher for your item and sometimes there is really none,0
10199,you should also put into consideration not to deliver a parcel to an office address during holidays personally that s common sense but no apparently your company do not have that as per protocol i even answered the redelivery form that i submitted before the hr deadline and yet my parcel wasn t redelivered what s the point of the form if y all ain t going to come through holiday nga diba gusto niyo pumasok pa kami and break the time we had for ourselves para pumunta ng trabaho,0
10200,it really save me lots of times and monies thanks lazada,1
10201,it was cool gadgets here and very fast delivery this cool items was very thankful to me for the vlog or live steaming thank you so much for the seller next order please,1

10206,nice and good very accommodating,1
10207,makes getting things you need very easy and convenient,1
10208,what i hate are the malicious ads that try and force me to download this app or the popup ads that redirect me here at google play i probably would have eventually downloaded this app normally since i also use shopee but other sources of media like shareit and other websites just forcefully download this app onto my phone without my permission i decided to make this review because this marketing is really getting out of hand edit the reply bot doesn t understand my review and i either cannot see my review on mobile or it was deleted,0
10209,i love lazada great deals and discounts you can apply multiple vouchers on a single item the best shopping app,1
10210,lazada forces user to install app even before viewing the products why cant u wait until i am interested and click the button to place my order then install,0
10211,ganda ng app very well will recommend this to my friends,1
10212,first time ordering from lazada tried multiple times to add delivery address but all attempts failed tried on a different phone same result pls fix glitch,0
10213,i like this app better because they have a return policy which the other one does not have,1
10214,nice good app but loading slow,1
10215,it is easy to use will be enhanced if payments are linked to local e wallet such as ovo shopee dana gopay,1
10216,the lazada app makes my shopping life easier it is a friendly user apps madaling gamitin ang voucher and also free shipping even sa coins nagagamit mo din kaya magbigay ako ng stars,1
10217,they lie about shipping times in many cases terrible app to use to many popups trying to sell you garbage,1
10218,very convenient and affordable po low prices pa ty,1
10219,i make orders but they never arrive in bongabong even i pay nobody deliver i like to know whats wrong and why delivery did not happens this is not the first time,0

10225,good service and comfortable to shopping,1
10226,horrible app they make customers cancel their oders and cause wait their goods in a long time then when their customers cancel their orders lazada punishs their customers i m sick about that,0
10227,i used redmart twice every week before it switched to lazada i have always had issues with lazada but now that i have to use it very frequently its problematic everytime i log in on my laptop using my gmail account lazada asks me for permission the app itself is very slow and takes very long for the listing of items payment is always a problem i always select remember my card but everytime i have to enter the information again i dont have enough space to write all problems,0
10228,many choices fast delivery convinient,1
10229,these product is easy to install and bright unlike others h bulb adapter have to cut off the bottom nipper to fit in the led light kindley ajust the adapter alinement for your sales wasted hours to fixed it,1

10235,would have given stars just can t find the pay now button,1
10236,so far so good just buy in official store,1
10237,keep up the good honest service thank you lazada🥰,1
10238,app is great but right now they are acting like a mushroom instead of being relevant they are just annoying they just pop up out of nowhere,0
10239,improve your shipping system it s very inconsistent some items are shipped and delivered fast while others extremely slow and tracking are like not always accurate so far other than that this app is fine,1
10240,so far so good,1
10241,lazada is a very reliable when it comes to online shopping,1
10242,payment keeps failing i ve tried times but keeps failing could be because of but it should be basic for it to withstand the traffic this makes me unsure if lazada can be trusted,1
10243,like the app though sometimes the app slows down so i have to close and re open it,1
10244,being used to western online shopping this company is just pathetic the products are generally of poor quality and considering which country they operate in the prices are too high you can get higher quality items on amazon for example that are only to higher in price sad to see a company ripping off people who in many cases don t have money to spare the customer service is essentially non existent impossible to cancel or return items too bad the options are worse,0
10245,lazada is perfect for shoppers like me,1
10246,bullcrap stop sending me pop up ads,0
10247,the best online shop super fast ang shipping,1
10248,intervening too much with my phone,0
10249,this app all over the place when u need order the item your money wallet will taken instantly but when cancel or refund will taken forever even item not actually buy,0

10259,easy to understand and good discribtion,1
10260,i cannot set up may address keeps on saying invalid postal code,0
10261,and this app is dumb like it was made years ago the search function is bad the ads keep pop up did you guys check out the shopee app yet,0
10262,sellers never reply shipping takes forever and the products sold are all fake and poor quality,0

10271,easy and simple to use,1
10272,one of your sellers is a liar i refunded the money then you put it back on my wallet account i can t edit my mobile and email address as i don t have access anymore i contacted customer service and provided a valid id but still nothing s change all of your agents are liars as they don t do what they promised me i bought the item sept received it on i already talked to agents and it s days now and they said it s still on process what are you a scammer,0

10397,lazada could at least filter out bogus sellers or make contact with them i d recommend shopee but not this,0
10398,the lazada tried to find the place and exact address and they will try to reach out your phone and communicate with the costomers reminding your items will be deliver at your door,1
10399,just a stupid a way of advertising their app so stupid it s almost annoying that their app automatically opens on every pop up ads and even when uninstalled it just redirects to playstore got so desperate ehh you re just disappointingly desperate my dear,0

10491,easy to shop the delevery on time thank lazada,1
10492,very comfortable and easy to access the app and past delivery and order tracking easy to apply voucher and easy refund,1
10493,lazada scams it seems very hard to get refund from them after they let seller scam you on missing item or broke item or keep charging you extra shipping for sellers mistake remember lazada make money off of all this so they have no reason to really care as long as they get their money the problem is sometimes they are one of the few places to order things so you have to take your chances sellers will also mark blames delivery failed or change even if you did not do any of that,0
10494,nice items and delivery on time,1
10495,good lucky big,1
10496,if i was to go shopping online lazada is the safest i usually dnt just buy i look for good reviews st and lazada offers precise and honest to goodness product reviews the app is also user friendly and the navigation is very easy good job lazada,1
10497,i love browsing here in online shop like lazada thank you lazada love it,1
10498,false promises on vouchers just to get your personal details nothing is intuitive the app is cluttered with so many adverts that you cannot find anything you are actually looking for when linked to the app via online browsing you loose your basket contents and have to start again,0
10499,makin improve mantap free shipping pon banyak,1
10500,this online shopping app is perfectly necessary for our lives especially in the midst of pandemic lazada is really helpful to us for our daily needs they have discounts free shipping vouchers and more giveaways and prizes that can help us as a online shoppers to less in expenses please continue your service to us as your number one fan cause lazada is number one online shopping app thank you,1
10501,shipment arranged by lazada itself very very poor i can rate star for the delivery for the customer service star as they re always claimed to be busy and star for funds if there is a way to do cash in you suppose to have cash out or fund withdrawal option as well like shopee they always make it possible for their buyers hope management will consider my over all reviews,0
10502,i purchased an item under label lazpicks i assumed their recommendations would mean trusted seller but this does not seem to be the case as i was sent different phone very bad first experience others warned me but the bargain was to good to be true i will update if lazada fix the problem update lazada is officially ignoring me via their app i got ripped off use at ur own risk update item returned still no refund,0
10503,very good app its been yrs and still use this app,1
10504,bought several items using shopee dealing with local seller have been excellent however foreign sellers are as untrustworthy as shopee support case bought item that does not work from foreign seller engage seller no response for several days when a response came no solution was offered engage shopee support replied but asked to wait for days waited for weeks and no response from shopee tried to contact shopee again non responsive buy shopee products from foreign seller at your own risk you will have no support from shopee or the seller thereafter wanted to give a star but nope since foreign seller are a big part of shopee they dont deserve the extra star disappointed,0
10505,very good in providing the on line buyers with legit seller quality not bogus thanks,1
10506,you can trust this app it is really good and the interface is user friendly it also support multi language and it is amazing it makes my shopping awesome,1
10507,so far all the item ill get from the stores are all good so thank you lazada,1
10508,sometimes ok sometimes k o those sellers wth low rating should be expelled from laz platform,1
10509,i think the app is easy to navigate however more online bank options should be added,1
10510,rather than pay large amount of money to pay celebrities on lazada sales better lazada hire a good resolution manager to solve customer issue after sales is bad manager on duty ignorance seller can get away with anything better think twice before buy from lazada especially the stuff you bought expensive coz after sales will hit you hard,0
10511,love shopee million stars for them,0
10512,the worst they give the drivers your number now i have an angry delivery guy cursing at me because he doesn t deliver when i am home worst thing i tried to contact lazada and they don t respond awful company will not buy again unless contacted by them to sent screenshots of the harrasment,0

10878,i can t checkout items after selecting items from cart and clicking the checkout button it always says something went wrong on our side please refresh page and proceed to checkout even tried on web browser on pc same message after clicking checkout button edit same day it seems i can only checkout one item at a time it works but a hassle,1
10879,shoppee seller does not honour time sale after i paid and say is shoppee fault and ask me to cancel a order and top up sgd to buy again,0
10880,this is my first time i find it so awesome thank you lazada,1
10881,it is better than the shopee app unfortunately they ve removed the free shipping even if it s more the k unlike before,1
10882,miss the redmart app now in lazada font is too small can t chope delivery slots and cart is not as user friendly without the save for later shopping on the redmart app used to be so enjoyable so easy to navigate clean yet so usable far better than amazon prime or ntuc can t quite say the same now it was such an asset in my opinion stopping the app is a loss for redmart unless lazada makes it exactly the same as it was lazada app is too cluttered,1
10883,good,1
10884,lousy apps i was told to uninstall the apps again n again as i failed to verify number and failed to add my card details tried so many times wasting my time,0

10898,lazada service is poor this time and its so strick to order more goods at same time its so expensive delivery fee i am using this app its not easy to cancel goods you order because of item restrictions,0
10899,idiot apps topped up few hundreds ewallet end up not able to place order contacted cs no feedback even h cheat money go n use verified ic or tumbprint to verify your buyers catch those resellers or script users dun take my money developer contact given false email thats cheating,0
10900,i love this app more orders the more happier,1
10901,so far lazada the best eventhough i didn t know what courier they provided for delivery my parcel but lazada better from s e because they provide free shipping everyday i really hope my experience with lazada will turn out to be good experience,1
10902,i don t have the application why are you keep spamming your ads,0
10903,nice easy shopping w discount,1
10904,the shipping fee still cheap tumaas but not that much,1
10905,it s a very great app you should download it if you like online shopping just be sure to check the ratings of the item you want to buy to be sure that it has good quality and will not disappoint you its very easy to order here in lazada thx lazada,1
10906,the app s adverts are always popping out of nowhere and they make fake escape buttons in there ads so it s very annoying,0
10907,you can purchase a lot of stuff without problems but the app is too invasive that it drains your battery and runs in the background checking on the sites you access through ads,0
10908,frequent unwanted notifications and no option to turn them off the app is harder to use than the website even on mobile,0
10909,i really love dz app but there s only one thing i don t want here coz sometimes some of the riders doesn t want to deliver the package in exact address as written on the delivery package for me i ordered some item i hope they ll also deliver it at the add written,1
10910,nice nice nice,1
10911,i like the freedom of shopping on my budget and free time without the hassle of traffic,1
10912,there are lots of good products and affordable price,1
10913,useless app today ever i keep choosing products to buy but all of the products are out of stock surely there is a problem with the app cuz for what i know this app won t be possible able to sold out every products fix this and be useful so very useless app,0
10914,excellent deals and hassle free shopping,1
10915,awesome app it s working properly but the updates makes my device laggy and slow yet the app is working good i m giving stars,1
10916,very reliable app,1
10917,the app needs fixing in regards to the notifications and lag times also the status of delivery is confusing because it shows that you have items for shipping but when you open it there s nothing because everything has been delivered or is currently being delivered same with the status of cancelled or to pay for orders very confusing please fix it thank you,1
10918,its good but know to many fake seller sir giving wrong product item and no good quality also only picture description photo is good in reality negative its hard to fight expectation to reality and other seller not goos communication bad not respondable not replying the other sir,1

10926,the things they sell is so cheap but shopee is expensive,1
10927,item received in great condition even it takes awhile to reach here no dents on the box great delivery method,1
10928,noticed china based e shops in this platform is being rifed with more sellers that niether deliver the exact item what they post nor ship at all this includes sellers that has previous good reviews lazada having customers do the follow up for a delayed orders whilst the sellers use chatbots spouting generic responses doesn t help at all and worse if you happen to get a refund in your card beacuse of the incompetence of the sellers you also get a deduction for the reversal you can t control,0
10929,very fast service none like this in any online sale,1
10930,as above now all my orders are in good condition when they delivered on time delivery thank you lazada,1

11310,lazada is great for finding occasional deals and discounts on a wide variety of products whenever i go shopping for shoes clothing electronic devices appliances or gadgets i always do a quick search on lazada to compare prices however the developers could do more to screen rd party vendors to ensure that only authentic products are listed on the app market,1
11311,i ended up uninstalling it the ads are notoriously spam every website that has a redirect ad to it always launches the app and messes up my search not cool,0
11312,i have encountered several dubious shady sellers since i started on shopee about months ago these sellers give shopee a bad name st seller sent me a message claiming the item is out of stock but i noticed it is still available but at a higher price nd seller also claim another product is out of stock but the item continues to be put up for sale on shopee also big thick bath towel turned out to be only a small thin face towel many of shopee s sellers are unreliable,0
11313,is the only app with no problem for delivery,1
11314,great shopping and amazing deals,1

11350,very poor customer service they ll give you the hassle unlike with shoppee the csr is very attentive and very kind in assisting all issues at first i thought lazada is better than shoppee but defintely not shoppee is way much better especially whenever you had problems with the products you received csr right awa assists you fixes the problem with just a chat or email very far from lazada they give you all the stress in reporting a lacking products received when you even paid the exact amount,0
11351,very amazing with more prizes and promotions,1
11352,the app needs to be optimize i ve been using gb ram phone with good connection but still took too much time loading on every item i wanted to check compared to shopee lazada app is way too slow imo,0
11353,very good app lazada is far better than shopee now that the shipping costs have been reduced,1
11354,this app deserve star for their poor service also there are too many scammers here if you need help you will be pass on a bot to talk but the bot gives inaccurate information they should send you a text message that your order will be delayed due to some problems but no they will make you worry about the product what a dissappointment,0
11355,difficult refunds for foreigners,1
11356,good place to online shopping,1
11357,fast check out and delivery more savings,1
11358,might want to change my review to star if they actually fixed the feature they ve changed please bring back the option to filter and view star reviews that is very helpful to see bad experiences about the product and without that buyers cant see the legitimacy and problems of the product which is mostly can be seen on star reviews other than that the app and the shopping is still good its just that they remove one of the most important features they had and i hope they gave it back,1
11359,very efficient i like it and i told to my friends about lazada and my friends addicted to order in lazada,1

11709,was started with often purchased from this apps what others shared about their experience is true and what most annoyed was when they cancelled my order the return amount always lowest then the amount i paid for the cancellation item i asked the seller and seller said it was all with lazada because they haven t done anything with the item purchased since the product was sold out this time lazada took i paid and the cancellation fund only returned to me,0

11724,my orders always got cancelled silently this was the third time my order had been cancelled without any notification i would rather buy from shopee that would notify me whenever anything happens to my order there is no control or whatsoever on merchants who cancel orders without any valid reasons and ridiculously merchants the few i met can tell you that their items are out of stock theyre undergoing technical issues to fulfill order and lazada doesn t alarm you of such merchants,0

11879,oke,1
11880,my experience in lazada online shiffing is good service and honest delivery employe,1
11881,normally lazada is very good for well priced high quality products however responsive sellers are still let down by some very bad sellers who promote products that are sold out or pack and despatch orders at their own convenience or respond very slowly or not at all to chat messages before buying from lazada i recommend you check out seller s rating any seller with less than a positive rating should stop selling on lazada and open their own shop on street they let down lazada,1
11882,like it and well packed no breakage,1
11883,i hope there is an option where our home address should be hidden if its not used so we will not became a victim of scammers,1
11884,slow delivery and laggy app,0
11885,thank you this is good quality 🤗,1
11886,crash free so far online shopping has never been this easy with lazada,1

11896,very friendly and easy to use app,1
11897,set a address as default but when ordering the delivery address is point to the secondary address what s the use of setting default address if this is the case especially when snatching for flash deal item user cannot afford to spare time changing address else u can t get the flash deal item but after order system and customer support backend both also cannot update the address for the order,0
11898,legit sellers and very good items no hassle in waiting for deliveries,1
11899,the best app i always buy in lazada i love lazada,1
11900,very poor customer support unable to speak to rep about returns rely on chat but no one really respond to the chat,0

11914,if you are looking for items very difficult to find in physical stores get them from lazada although a number of items are bit more expensive than in stores it can readily compensate the comfort and safety while shopping from home and there are sellers who have taken advantage of the platform to sell counterfeit items so be very careful make a thorough check overall enjoy shopping at lazada,1

11916,any items are available and reasonable price,1

12007,its fast and worked best for me,1
12008,when you have a dispute they will refuse to give back your money they protect the sellers the dispute will be cancel after sellers give stupid reason and they have so call dispute team that will contact you and never contact you very bad experience good luck those ordering your item might get lost and you might not get your money back and so call customer service will just ask you to wait,0
12009,only shop at lazmall stores otherwise there is a likelihood of a botched service,1

12022,the app is abit laggy and the button seems to be deliberately place where your fingers will press it quite irritated by it maybe its just me,0
12023,if you want to buy stuff on lazada please choose cash on deliver option if the item received is wrong then you dont pah if you pay using debit or redit and recwive wrong order the seller will not reply and need to male a refund you will waste a lot of time you also need to send back the item to lazada theres a lot of scammer on lazada and lazada didnt do anything happened to me bought so many times on lazada and will stop due to this bad experience try to use other app,0
12024,i return my item to lazada warehouse alamat penerima sy letak address lazada warehouse in subang jaya selangor but u return it back to me,0
12025,seller tagged my package delivery as a failure after first try of a delivery hat arrived one day before their estimate apparently it is expected for customers to stay at home until packages arrive ordered another item and same thing happened this time they delivered the item days in advance i waited for them the whole day in my office address this time they called me and i was no longer there now they tagged the delivery as a failure,0

12046,most trusted online shopping platform for me,1
12047,lazada is a great app it is really great but why did i gave it star it is because lazada adds are everywhere even though i didn t click it it annoyingly led me to the application even when i don t want to use it please fix this btw i already deleted this app because of that,1
12048,might as well add some other i ds like postal id philhealth etc when it comes to verifying lazpaylater,1
12049,it is good even sometimes does not on time atleast still they deliver ninja van unlike lbc they are not delivering most of the time they just send message parcel is lost or no one to receive which is a very big lie,1
12050,in my experience using the lazada app is very convenient there s a lot of exciting deals like piso sale free vouchers that can save money and also there s more ways to earn credits to buy your things wants and needs by just joining to their contests inviting others and win some prizes all of that is legit i already experienced win k of credits earn credits and buy stuff without spending money buy foods for only just peso imagine that s a big save right so what are you waiting for,1
12051,unceasing surprises on rewards upon rewards for buyers who use to do purchases on this e commerce platform as a new user lazada captivates my interest to check in every now and then for more surprises,1

12073,i m surprised by lazada there is a stealth package i didn t order anything at all but the item didn t clearly come to the house fortunately the item was cheap it looks like this game is an unscrupulous distributor or a delivery service office that might manipulate my personal data address which happens to be a lazada customer now disappointed i want to delete this application this threatens the security of my personal data and is quite detrimental in terms of material be careful using,0
12074,reset to zero when checking item in cart,1

12078,fraud online platform useless customer service keep asking you for screenshots when vendor can t fulfil their commitment and then ask consumer to go liasie with vendor yourself only at losing end if you use their service,0
12079,too many advertisements which are not only annoying but it interferes with the app and calls i am in the advertisements are rude and intrusive this violates the consumers privacy,0
12080,highly recommend this shop,1

12098,some sellers just after customers money sellers must be do their best for excellent business for good not just for onetime,1

12100,the application is great however the ads are terrible and deceptive lazada is generating lots of income and it is probably one of the most popular platform in e shopping you don t need to waste your resources by putting annoying and useless ads in every app,0

12141,overall a great company to deal with and the majority of their suppliers sell good quality and great priced items you need to shop around a little as they have many suppliers selling the same merchandise but prices can vary but there are great bargains to be found,1
12142,some of the merchant are not reliable i ordered an item sometime ago but was not delivered merchant insisted item was delivered i had to rope in the back end support team to justify and void that order hope this will not happen again,0

12199,i would give this app stars as i have been using it for years but the package i ordered has been stuck in logistics for a month now lazada customer support has been very receptive but has accomplished nothing and can t even give me an exact delivery date apparently quad x is not picking up the package bottom line if you want packages to be actually delivered to your door stay away from quad x i will update this review once you have actually processed my order,0
12200,easy to order and no scammer very nice apps,1
12201,easy to use easy to understand,1
12202,i like the way menus and items are presented ease of use when navigating and its display of total amount per item when entered into the cart even before checkout the item s description and details are available and can easily be displayed the items are mostly of better quality at reasonable price more discounts during special sale however some sellers are not available for chat makes me doubt the sincerity of the seller to lazada blacklist sellers who frequently send wrong items,1
12203,as long as all the seller is trusted seller i gave star,1
12204,likely comfortable for shopping on,1
12205,exciting and you can buy goods for less,1
12206,wasn t a fan of online shopping but prices in here are cheaper and you don t need to leave home to buy reading the reviews help a lot,1

12209,good and easy to find and buy whatever you want,1
12210,just today received items not as pictured or described and not the brand advertised before i ordered i checked the rating of the seller it was nice thinking that ratings was legit mostly topmost comments were ok then suddenly today i was able to open the reviews and most negative it was hidden and placed at the bottom pesos is not a joke my daily wage is only for u to scam it that is panlalamang u should also check ur sellers and put them in jail,0
12211,easy to use and fast,1
12212,mudah dan menyenangkan friendly to use,1
12213,chán,0
12214,this app is quite ok but tiki customer service is too terrible,0
12215,it s so convenient and so easy to shop,1
12216,please be advised that the courrier lbc you opted to deliver my package is not delivering our products we expect that it would be delivered but instead we are forced to go to there regional office to claim our package they dont even call or notify us that we need to pick it up or if they will deliver and its not the first time they ve done it this is a bad business for you and a negative experience to us instead choose ninja van and i might re evaluate my review,0
12217,very convenient and so far kazada and seller are good,1
12218,was soooo good their services i give,1
12219,much better than walking while window shopping at malls thanks lazada,1
12220,so is it more safer to use cod vs card some drivers can decide to tag the package as delivered even though it s not no call no text and suprisingly with proof of delivery with incorrect spelling of my name on it,0
12221,good,1
12222,add split screen or landscape feature,1
12223,good and not so good always high shipping costs,1

12228,save time save my money and excellent delivery at my door,1
12229,i have been patiently waiting for my parcel to be delivered even though it was beyond the estimated delivery time then your courier cancelled my order because apparently i refused to accept the package i did not even received any calls or sms from the courier regarding the delivery,0
12230,there s nothing wrong with the app itself i dunno if it s also you guys who s managing the ads that leads to the app but your ads is too sensitive it s getting out of hand this add appears in the middle of nowhere then you gotta finish watching it then clicking the real x option but still opens the app i know it s not app relevant but if you guys r d one making d ads make it less touch sensitive,0
12231,so easy to shop and geat discounts i will recommend this to all my relatives and friends thanks lazada,1
12232,very accessible online shopping apps,1
12233,so far so good naman ang mga naaavail kong items and well satisfied great job lazada,1
12234,why the notifications keep on showing on my lazada apps icon it is annoying when i open the apps but it stated no message notification,1
12235,be smart enought to order items because some sellers do it for business only look for customers review and be wiser all in all lazada was a great app for me,1
12236,best ever before i love shopee but shopee always trick me in term of the vouchers 🤣 so i try lazada and let me tell you i am so happy with this apps everything is straightforward regarding to the voucher i can also see the total amount that i had to pay without having to click the check out button its so convenient it is just sometimes when i search for something but the search result is different but overall really good,1

12278,annoying and disappointing user interface speaking its good but when it terms of promo like loading promo it sucks not everyone is priviledge to avail and purchase the promo always responsing no target crowd and blah blah when my internet connection is strong and my is updated shopee is way more better in loading promos and other priviledges at least there as long as its load not sold out and you haven t reach the maximum limit you are able to avail the promos unlike in this app so bad,0

12536,to avoid scam you should let the customers open the package in front of the courier while the courier is taking video if the item inside the package is not what it says on the suppose content description then the receiver has the right to not pay for it and cancel it right there and then this scammers are using your company to prey on your faithfull customers,1

12970,when item ordered were not delivered within time frame as promised the tracking website could still say that several delivery attempts were made when overdue delivery was finally made at pm we interviewed the courier and found out that the item delivered was only picked up a day before stayed with the courier for a day because their courier’s delivery van was “colored coding” thus it was their first attempt window given for delivery says “ anytime within the next three days do they expect person authorized to receive delivery to be on stand by for day courier do not call nor leave message we have to call all unknown missed call coming in our cellphone we even tested back to unknown numbers saying pls come during office hours worst is that after complaining to the customer care all their answers are what they were trained to do “ within the box although they are quite fast in sending you summary calls which also were all “patterned” statements not addressing your concern request for assistance to talk to person in authority to help customer is nil reason given is that they have many calls to attend was referred to live chat who are no different,1

13042,so much worse than redmart s app was tons of ads unintuitive interface design a relatively broken shopping cart if i have redmart checked why is it unchecked every time i add something poor product discoverability which should be a concern when the platform makes revenue by sales volume now they are charging liveup members for redmart delivery on some slots as well which defeats the purpose of that subscription cancelled and will stop using amazon is looking better these days,0

13087,most annoying ads are lazada linked ads especially if i install lazada the linked ads will bring me to open lazada apps waiting and to close the app is another hassle where there are steps just to get out from ads trap and back to my browser i personally need to uninstall this app just because of that,0
13088,sometimes good but not at all because i order item then i received wrong item,0
13089,shipment thru lazada logistics is very slow unlike shoppee when the shipment arrives in your local hub it get delivered within the day but for lazada it gets delayed they only have few people delivering the parcels i guess to save more money and they ran out of delivery time and if the courier decides not to deliver on weekends expect for the delivery to get further delayed,0

13220,i cant use my lazada wallet even though it has balance it reflects zero when you i use it its a scam,0
13221,edit to lazada stop partnering with lex as your courier they will make your business down they are lazy they will mark the parcel delivery failed if they dont wish to deliver the parcel saying they attempted to deliver the parcel multiple times but they actually never tried to deliver the parcel they never contacted me about my parcel and said delivery failed i sent you report about the incident but you seem not interested and will still continue to work with the worst courier,0
13222,good,1
13223,as of now i don t have any bad experience in purchasing on lazada app it didn t disappoint me and i hope not in the future purchase it s really a big help for me to buy online because i m an ofw and a lot cheaper than to an actual store you just need to be more careful and be wise to choose a store and read some reviews before buying a product highly recommended,1
13224,lot of my parcels was tagged as unsuccessful delivery or often as delayed from the original delivery date sometimes they cancelled it without informing me the courier lex ph didn t contact me at all i did the courtesy on contacting them first since the contact info of the delivery man is indicated once the parcel is out for delivery but still no reply didn t made any attempt to deliver cs is useless can t properly addressed the issue,0

13229,do note shopee will not in charge of your refund and will not refund your money back if you do not receive the items unless the seller accept the request this is totally a scam so don t trust shopee guarantee money back if you do not receive the items,0
13230,my money top up extra inside after payment for taobao cannot withdraw back to bank account shopee can withdraw back why lazada cannot now my money stuck inside lazada cannot be use pls improve this asap,0

13541,don t appreciate being pushed to use the app by making the website borderline unusable also too many useless and annoying pop ups not appreciated either also as well you can only leave a rating after chatting with a store agent so if they don t respond at all they get away with terrible service great system very pro customer,0

13582,makes everything so much easier compared than actually leaving your home to hunt for items everything is delivered and most are cheaper with such a wide variety but easy to choose from product lists lazada s got it all,1
13583,fun farm is not working anymore and laz live is unavailable to view and the accounts ui is now all mess up not loading properly hope that the developers would see this and make a quick adjustment or just bring back the previous version before the last update,0

13588,i just got so disappointed that lazada just restricted my account after so many years of using it and keeping good standing with orders i tried to contact help center or chat but everything is just a bot ai answering i want to remove my account with this kind of treatment very disappointing,0
13589,been buying lots of stuff from lazada comparing to lazada before now are more secure and fast update also the apps really battery friendly compared to shopee loves the new system from lazada apps keep up the good work,1

13593,bad place to shop cancel order without confirm,0
13594,interface load slower compared to the previous update,1
13595,ordered to furnish my unit address upon check out is not verfied system as regards changes to the orders made is poor a few mins after placing my orders i realized the delivery address was wrong altbough i immediately contacted lazada and the vendors none could redirect the items to the preferred address they waste their rwspurces delivering to the address that they knew was wrong to begin with the chat to customer service sewms automated no rwal person responding,0
13596,to many fake brand and products be carefull all samsung kingston memory cards fake product s photos not true not real don t shopping for professional items no warranty have but lost time,0
13597,good service from a friendly courier thank you,1
13598,the review is just for the app itself not the actual company products sold or delivery just the app fugly,0
13599,nice service and fast delivery,1
13600,the apk is actually good unfortunately i am rarely able to browse from the apk it always shows the blank screen so that i decide to browse lazada through website when i opened from website from my mobile phone it opened in the apk again so i decide to uninstall the apk,0
13601,so good easy order deta faster apps ike that so easy,1
13602,your lazpay later is so frustating they will give you a credit line but if you will check out the items then suddenly theres an error and your credit line will be frozen you need to wait for a month again ive tried th times but theres no success ive emailed the customer service but they dont know very bad experience,0
13603,good but ew sorry i can t tell more information,1
13604,easy to use and many choice good,1
13605,i used to love this app but this time round i think that i will stop using this app because it doesnt let u get your refund when u didnt even freaking recieve your item like wth so u all think that money is easy to earn until the point that u can anyhow release the payment to the seller when the seller never send us our item so whats the point of having the refund button when shopee thinks that the seller is always right plus this isnt the first time this thing happen the seller have already tried to scam me the second time and shopee is not even doing anything use this app at your own risk edit what i opt for is standard express which is more expensive and its suppose to be guaranteed to send it to my doorstep so what is with the freaking not liable for lost normal mail thing wth u sure what i opt for is normal mailing are you trying to say that even express mailing will get lost haha thats funny man if so whats the point of having express mail if it is gonna get lost and the seller is not liable for it,0
13606,very little issues so far with purchase and delivery limited items but no major issues to worry about,0

13611,an easy way to shop,1
13612,always pop up by force like a salesmen kidnapping me and bring me to his shop to buy stuff not nice very forceful,0
13613,traps if to be used for catching mice need to adjust the spring in the bait assembly by cutting about turns in the spring to reduce the pressure in the actuator for big rats no problem for heavier weights,1
13614,good,1
13615,their customer service is a plus point especially from the help department credits to ela liza and especially specifically bien for the excellent sercive efforts,1
13616,no notification from the app and have to check manually to know my thing are om delivering status driver depart at am and deliver a package at pm to an office bravo please teach your driver that most office working hour is until pm only no doubt star rating,0
13617,lazada used to be a good shopping app with more item variety better prices compared to competitors and fast delivery but nowadays the app is bloated with too many activities going on at once search results are entirely irrelevant to what i m trying to find delivery has been painfully slow and innacurate to the parcel s actual location worst of all with no way to cancel and refund support chat bot is downright useless for your peace of mind shopping online use any other app,0
13618,it help me to get my basic needs with discounts and other promotions,1
13619,efficient and effective,1

13634,express shopping but your lex couriers suck in davao city they won t call just show up and will not exert effort unlike other couriers in other shopping site will call if they are near the area to alert the owner lazada maybe great but your lex couriers make it a bad experience btw lazada did this to me several times already,0

13638,please improve the history of previous transactions right now i have to click and get thru one by one to see what item i bought because there s instance that i want to buy that again and i don t have to spend more time if the seller and item are good and legit,1
13639,lazada tracking is terrible they should get with there delivery services and demand they tell the people we re there item is like lbc it says its at th lsb station we re is that it dose not show what city it is in so you have no idea we re your item is make no sense to me to have a tracking app that the delivery service can t tell it customer what city there item is at,0

13653,bogus we reported to a customer service agent how one of their hubs are mistagging orders as failed delivery when there wasn t actual delivery attempt made and instead of following through with what the cs rep promised us to schedule it for redelivery they tagged the order as failed delivery minutes after the call ended so shameless i hope they do a in depth review to the corrupt system of their local hubs as what they re doing is fraud and should be reviewed by dti i pity the seller,0
13654,there are lots of shops that sell the same thing and it s difficult to tell one from the other otherwise lots of options are good,1
13655,so amazing app in the wold lazada the best one,1
13656,when i upload a photo it refreshes back to blank review so i use drsktop but can t earn the coin before i can use the coins for discounts now i don t know what s the use for but overall sellers i engage with are professional in their business some items though are deceiving for they give price as though high quality however i find some cheap but excellent in quality,1

13693,if lazada is really sincere to give the discounts coupons vouchers they should not only limit to payments by lazada wallet how many e wallets can a consumer hold it s difficult to keep track of your finances if every online platform ask every customer to hold one,1
13694,purchases are very easy sellers are ethical deliveries and transactions are smooth and good to shop on lazada,1
13695,very good in service,1
13696,lousy website suspend my account without providing any explanation and just told me suspended one day out of sudden i have been buying regularly and paying promptly for my orders i rather go buy from qoo and lazada no big deal really soar loser company,0

13698,issue started feb most of the photos are not showing up it is very annoying and i am already thinking of switching to other online store app,0
13699,hated the way shopee would just release the money after a certain period to seller even without buyer receiving the items yet as i have to constantly check if the items have reached the add plus an incident whn i bought from a seller but the seller didn t disclore full details and in the end it couldn t be used went to email to shopee but they just ask me to ask the seller myself and without checking on any progress shopee just close the case aftr some time srsly cld improve alot on cust serv,0
13700,cool make shopping easy just waiting for days and sometimes the delivery was delay but fun,1
13701,all emails about your orders are in thai language even though i have selected my account to be english also the constant barrage of spamm seller recommendation vouchers seller promotion are getting real annoying really difficult to actually find out when a seller contacts you about your order in the midst of all of that spam many times i simply never see that they have written to me,0
13702,delivery fees are sometimes too expensive,1
13703,easy and convenience shopping,1
13704,tiki do the bad work recently no check stock in caused split the orders delay in delivery which also caused not many h delivery products telephone services team cannot catch the customer s questions or maybe pretend to be customers only accept the apology for once not for all the times,0

13708,as buyers huzzle free service of lazada and prices also quality is very much appteciated,1
13709,not all sellers are honest but it s stars for lazada,1
13710,so far is a good platform to buy items especially on sale with coupons customer service is responsive though need to keep track of the sale as the auto completion of sale can be a bit of issue when item not received,0

13726,so far the most reliable online shopping app in the world,1

13740,lazada is definitely faster than shopee i do still stand by this day that lazada is way faster than shopee when it comes to deliver service lazada only takes a week for an overseas package to arrive while shopee takes ages making you wait for too long this is only my own opinion based on using them for over a year keep up the work lazada team,1
13741,it s super affordable in lozada buy now,1
13742,i just don t like that they had to put shipping or delivery charges again per store,1

13878,i admit i m a new user to lazada but i can feel it a great platform to shopping compared to shopee i ve been cheated by shopee too many times but here in lazada the seller handled their business in a manner ways i have shop at lazada and i have to admit it many of it i have great deals with a reasonable price it s really outstanding platform,1
13879,user friendly you can find great deals during flash sales most of the items sold at reasonable price,0
13880,great friendly and reliable shopping apps,1
13881,cheaper alternatives and some with free shipping,1
13882,a lot of fake sellers misleading ads prices are a bit pricey than shopee paylater nit activated i uninstalled this due to these reason i only reinstalled it because the seller of original jbl has an acct here only and nowhere else am gonna unistalled this again as soon as i got my order,0
13883,whenever i browse its always showed up and its annoying i give this star,0
13884,great place to shop till you drop,1

13894,fast delivery and good quality,1
13895,it super faster delivery thank you lazada,1
13896,you really have to be careful when ordering stuff the posted prices beside the item descriptions are often times misleading the low prices are for items that are not what the picture shows flash sales are just prices that are not even the items that shows on the feed very very misleading so read carefully before placing an order i doubt that they would even bother regulating posts,0

13898,shopee ph scammer,0
13899,not good anymore no more free shipping and items delivery now takes so long unlike before that you can get your order the next day worse you have to pay for delivery for every single item that you ordered and it will still take a week seriously,0
13900,it s a scam shopee guarantees a refund if the goods are not received as described however i have paid shopee on th jan and the goods were not even shipped out yet today on th feb it s not even on a boat to me at the moment the seller simply refused to talk to me and refused to ship meanwhile shopee won t let me cancel the order because the seller refused the cancel request my money is gone and i m not getting the goods seems like shopee has simply pocketed my money,0
13901,i hate ur force popup ads auto direct me here every single time stupid ads,0
13902,just started use quite convience to purchase items,1
13903,lazada app opens whenever some random ads pop out while browsing they should remove this spam ads feature its really annoying but the app itself is good i rate it but is fine for jow till they remove this stupid feature,0
13904,the lazada does not control its sellers so even though the low quality of the merchandise goes down in the lazada not like the shoppee all the goods limit it and it is strictly to its products especially to the sellers,0
13905,i m satisfy with lazada s service keep it up dear lazada so helpful in this pendemic for purchase from home,1

13988,too many ads,0
13989,nice app easy to order enjoying shopping,1
13990,very nice and good quality,1
13991,very nice app the only problem is that there are sellers that pretend to buy be customers of their own products so sometimes other stores are very skeptical suspicious if you haven t seen a single review yet,1

13993,quick and easy online shopping,1

14003,lazada customer care don t care about you issue not resolved and no updates at all,0
14004,it is very useful to buy anything we want,1
14005,the system used in this app is very bad especially in payments and refunds the use and withdrawal of refunds always fail it seems to force me to spend my money that has been deposited worst system among all e commerce,0
14006,products have good quality,1
14007,useless app if you want to get scammed then continue using this app also if you re planning to scam people online then this is the app for you they don t intervene and listen to their customer s complain they ll automatically protect the sellers from said complains so they can continue scamming people at peace use other apps when buying online instead,0

14128,lazada used to have fast shipping but now it would be a miracle if the item is shipped and received in less than a week it goes from logistics to logistics which i think is the reason why shipping takes forever as to the app relatively okay but try shopee first and if shopee has the item you need go for it instead,1

14197,great user interface design and easy navigation the in built games are interesting and fun too two downside i have had is sellers pm to say item is out of stock but yet item is still out in the listing also the other being if the overseas tracking can allow users to open up the actual web link of the service because there may be times where the tracking services be delayed due to some circumstances in which it is not stated in the app,0

14205,lazada is cheating a lot i ordered a tablet wanted to return but lazada agent rejected the return though valid proof submitted think twice to order go for shopper or other apps,0
14206,one of the ugliest user interface online sellung flatform,0
14207,there are lot of fake items i bought major marshall headphones and received fake ones reported it its been more than a week and no action is taken also i have written a review for the item the seller simply deleted the old product listing and created a new one and hence no reviews and to my wonder there is a shopee preferred tag for the same item which is reported long back consumers beware please buy genuine items from a trusted website instead of falling prey of lower prices,0
14208,i like the way lazada made my refund it s easy for me that s why when i saw another sale item i immediately place an order,1
14209,good item fast delivery etc,1

14215,great shopping galore,1
14216,i just hope lazada introduce a tiering system like their competition shopee tiers that earns rewards etc could be based on total number of items purchased total purchased value etc innovate,1
14217,your stupid app keeps bringing me to your site when i m trying to download something in google wish i could rate this a out of absolutely hate this app thanks to you i can t install a goddamn thing from google you are a blood sucking annoying hateable mosquito that i cannot get rid of there s nothing you can do to make me delete this comment and i mean absolutely nothing you already ruined my day after you appeared right in front of my eyes get your stupid site out of here,0
14218,hope good quality your items to be delivered,1
14219,lazada is nice but i put free shipping settings it s saying that it s free shipped but it s not there s only vouchers and the vouchers don t even match the price of the product,1
14220,this is handy already have multiple transactions using the app,1
14221,something is very wrong with the so called system behind this platform it automatically applies discount codes to your orders payments but sometimes e g sales events it encounters errors your orders are automatically cancelled and you are called violators of lazada s sales agreement how ridiculously all you do is collecting discount codes it offers and now you are a violator what s worse its customer service refuses to help violators when you call for an inquiry,0

14246,good services thank you lazada more power thank you to all staff,1
14247,misleading post a lot of product are posted together with a cheaper item as a variant to lower their display price its a clickbait tactic used by seller to deceive customers sometimes the cheapest item on the list is not even related to the real item you clicked for maybe as a solution you can display the price of the most expensive variant or display the price as a range,0

14383,so far so good but the free shipping vouchers need to be claimed first before they can be applied i think it would be better if in the checkout there s a list of vouchers that we can see instead rather than claiming the vouchers one by one then go back to checkout but still i like the voucher stacking,1

14593,can you improve your app why customers can cancel order while shipping it s not fair for our shop owner like me in lazada,0
14594,user friendly apps with a reasonable price,1
14595,i think not coins cant even be used and vouchers only for new comers and also for the items you dont need unlike the other competitor which is far more generous offer more voucher coins shipping fee discount etc instead of paying costly endorser addutu cart now lazada should focus on what buyers really like,0
14596,i rate this this is such a annoying app i m trying to made a account and it s not working i have load but nothing is popping up worse app ever,0
14597,what a bad experience support staff syifaa cut me off the chat halfway because she don t know how to resolve the matter as seller they make it confusing when buyer submits refund request so u end up losing your item and have to pay for refund their support staff will be polite and say sorry but tell u they can t help at all edit apr i got ended by agent named iqbal abruptly again not sure why they have all these rude cs who can t solve any problems at all,0

14621,the suggestion home sucks please filter them and if the user already voted it down stop making it appear,0
14622,actually i don t have any problem about ordering products items in this app however the reason why i rated this in stars is because when i log in my account it automatically logged out when i m about to close the app also when i try to verify my mobile number an unknown number would appear in my message and it has a code in it i m afraid to put those code that was given to me because it might be a scam message from scammers lazada s please fix this problem thank you,1

14637,i have been using lazada for long time and it was a very good app but since past few months it s loosing it s charm the design update is terrible it s hard to even find simple things such as order history the home screen is so noisy and crowded that i feel just to exit the moment i launch the app it s looking more like a yellow pages website rather than lazada seriously what s with so many marketing materials my home page is filled with marketing material my chat screen is filled with marketing material is there any screen left that doesn t have marketing materials and not to mention the chat bot is just bad please get rid of it it s one of the worst has it been even tested after years of using the tool and being a live up member i decided to stop using it unfortunately i feel they totally lost it and that makes me really sad as it was my favorite shopping app and it used to be very good app,0

14836,great way to pay so convenient easy,1

14854,errors while downloading and installing the contents are confusing not really user friendly,1
14855,disappointing that shopee does not take action against dishonourable sellers who cancel the buyers s orders citing out of stock and changing the price instantly has happened twice to me this year and shopee does not take action despite the user reporting have decided to boycott this app till the team actually protects buyers more,0
14856,your ads keep on popping in every app that i use and even if i dont click it it goes directly to your app i swear its so annoying,0
14857,this app automatically downloads everytime i open the share it app i only use shopee not lazada so i keep on uninstalling the latter everytime,0

14860,products not like in the picture,0
14861,i ve been cheated of my money unsatisfactory quality of products purchased and my written complaints were ignored and it s such a hassle to return items not worth even star,0
14862,to much traffic is that your way to say that the sale item is not available if yes then you put there that it is sold already than making us expect that we can purchased but we cant,0
14863,goods theres so many vouchers,1
14864,gr,0
14865,one of the thing that i hate about lazada is the eligibility of using the coins with any items as you can only use it as a discount with limited items you can easily earn coins but it s hard to use it and it doesn t make any sense at all i still prefer shopee when using cashback coins when paying the order,0

14972,encountered horrible sellers in this app who doesn t respond to any enquiries have phone numbers that are not even active and without any valid business address looks like shopee need to improve its ecosystem of sellers otherwise it will be full of scam sellers who just waste your time and effort to chase them for updates on your orders one thing you can improve show how many percentage of items not shipped on time by sellers and how long is the average delay so customer know what to expect,0

14993,i am ready to give star if possible i never had such frustrating experience before but lazada gave me the twice the first time was years ago and my account was locked online payment and now it was lock for unknown reason as v although i did not dp anything during past few months i had raised ten thousand complaints via customer service either email channels but nothing was done i just have a very simple request give me an explanation of it but lazada never resolved my problem byebye,0
14994,some sellers like to make buyers misunderstandings for buying the wrong products as they are not like the products showing on the profile moreover some items are priced as bht but when the items are selected they are added bht for delivery of each item so the hole price is bht items those would be bht this way is extremely bad sellers,1
14995,convenient all my order is safe,1
14996,easy to shop 🤎 love it,1
14997,happy comfortable and easy to buy,1
14998,so very great and helpful apps highly recomended,1

15000,the best app highly recommended for onlineshopping,1
15001,very good shopping experience to lazda i love it 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰,1
15002,excellent service but at times confusing the ad says free shipping with a minimum of but not true,1
15003,worst app returns are almost impossible sellers are very adamant quality of cloths are also not good sizes and measurements are not appropriate always misleads the cuatomer,0
15004,better experience than other platform i just hope vouchers automatically added if detected available best tracking for rider as with pictures and contact just in case you re not around upon delivery time soooo convenient more power and more vouchers and free shipping plsss 🤗,1
15005,is not easy to choose the answer,1
15006,the best on line shopping,1
15007,sucks a lot of fake seller buy fake star rating but lazada never take action because lazada make money from them,0
15008,considerably very useful i do order constantly due to busy office work and lazada is a life saver thanks,1
15009,the app gets very slow and unresponsive after a few clicks even after i attempt resolve by spamming the back button on my galaxy s issue is only resolved after closing the app completely from the app manager however this is only a temporary solution as the unresponsiveness keeps occurring please fix asap even after several updates the issue is still present,0
15010,delivery charge is well worth it for quick delivery for so many products,1
15011,good suppliers all products that i have purchased are as described also all products delivered in generally good condition i hear a lot of stories of fake suppliers and products and i am happy lazada has done a good job of reviewing those,1
15012,fast and easy,1
15013,i m happy to shop here all the products are good,1
15014,so far so good hope my card info is in safe hand as i have a very bad bad experience with another online platform that withdrew my money in small amount and then went greedy to draw big thus bank alerted me please do not auto save the card details as it seems have a checkbox to allow user to click unsave thanks,0
15015,it s app is basic to order many products,1
15016,good tnx seller,1
15017,so so disappointed in picture it s so perfect in actual it s opposite i ll delete ur apps bcoz it s not worth it,0

15019,good enough but sometimes the price likely expensive,1
15020,easy and smooth interface,1
15021,quick responses with no glitches,1
15022,at first everything was fine and it was awesome however recently the app has been so annoying i tapped for sales alert for flash deals and nothing notified me and when i tried selling items on shopee when i type in the fullstop it is not allowed thus causing me to not be able to put in the price i want please fix this its driving me crazy,0
15023,excessive ads on almost every website i go to made me hate the app,0
15024,every online shopping app should be a pro consumer specially because consumers put their money and trust on the application and the name of the company itself its so frustrating to the part of the consumer to recieve defective or wrong items yes there is a returning option but we all know that it is so inconvenient you know that as well we even shoulder the payment to return the product wherein your sellers should done better in ensuring the quality of the product,0
15025,was such a great experience buying from this flatform althought it was my first time tq lazada for the great service,1
15026,it s great save time and money,1

15029,it is verry legitimate high quality,1
15030,great deals and service,1
15031,they have everything i am looking for and ordered for more than x and everything was fine it s much more better in my opinion to buy your needs wants here since they always have this promotion and discounted prices rather than to buy in a physical store good thing is you can also contact your delivery guy and can view the processes and can be able to message the seller privately if you have any queries there are no bugs in the app really a surely recommend,1
15032,the price are very affordable and at the same time no need to travel to get what you need love it,1
15033,when i got this app is good to ues and less than expecf like the other one i have but this one is great,1
15034,got a great experience with lazada and their delivery partner items in good condition and delivered always in time,1

15041,hope the items are legit and in good condition,1
15042,it helps me to find and buy things in a more detailed and well arrange price list,1
15043,worst experience ever i ordered something and i was supposed to receive it in april but i never received it i checked the delievery date and it was still april it says your estimated delievery date is april but i never received it then the shipping fee is so expensive and i regret downloading this app after i receive this product i will unisntall this app and btw shopee is way better than lazada anyways,0

15232,ever since i ve ordered in this platform my parcels are delivered complete and intact though it took a few days to be delivered because of my current location but still i m satisfied of their service more order to come lazada,1
15233,lazada is the platform for u to shopping online,1
15234,dont but this its fake i spent money but didnt get anything,0
15235,for some reason the app would open by itself when i m browsing using other apps i highly doubt it was accidentally clicked on while browsing because my fingers are no where near the ad there was no lazada ad to begin with and if there was ad it would be an ad for a different product app jesus christ talk about unethical business practices not using the app anymore your star ratings here are obviously fake,0
15236,very affordable and super good product,1
15237,good on apps sometimes seller not good,1
15238,so far so good,1
15239,lazada has improved quality of delivery services notifications are less obtrusive,1

15256,it was great being part of lazada online shopping so how can be part of the online shoppong i would love too all my family they keep on buying through online lazada ahopping i was envy too,1

15259,enjoyable and full of learning techniques,1
15260,always good service tracking system very good and drivers always helpful thanks,1
15261,the user interface is getting complicated and confusing for instance it cannot provide the remaining amount you have to pay if you cancel one order still shows the total amount with the cancelled order that s just one of the many complications look at shopee and benchamark to simplify if only my fave brand isn t here would have already uninstalled this one,0
15262,purchased good items so far have used many vouchers off for my purchases this time unlike before liked that lazada is now offering more of discount vouchers keep it up lazada,1
15263,it s my first time to order from lazada i hope i get the right order if so i will be one of your customer thank you,1
15264,it s okay but lazada why change a shipping fee like every product have a different transaction although i we ordered in same reseller,1
15265,too many ads not user friendly and expensive shopee is better,0
15266,why every site redirect to this your ad is a virus,0
15267,i love shopping at lazada esp during monthly sale but please do something to sellers who post pictures with misleading cheap prices it doesn t make a good shopping experience i will click but i will not buy and i will be pissed off when i see that the price is not related to the pictures posted but to another product please do not allow that kind of behavior,1
15268,good platform to buy goods,1
15269,it has so many products and still good conditioned products and delivered on desired date,1
15270,very easy way for buy things,1
15271,this damn app interrupts me every time i use my phone and it appears impossible to delete i will never ever use lazada if i live to be are they that desperate for business,0
15272,i have used this app many times and was able to make a successful order i even bought my phone here i did not expect that i will be tagged having suspicious activity on my account after i ve got a peso cashback from my most recent order,0

15284,fast delivery easy to air your side if you are facing difficulties with the sellers,1

15286,app bug unable to unfollow sellers who follow us still not fixed after so long despite numerous feedback to customer service in fact now more seller followers after they agree to fix bug app always hang slow down esp if more items in cart still can t allow us to copy paste in app whatever we type eg in review or etc except for improvement in being able to copy paste order id previously couldn t from my numerous feedback,0

15295,nice and fast delivery,1
15296,there were no items on my wishlist even tho i added so many things,0
15297,i hate this apps because your pop up ads in almost every website,0
15298,shopee doesn t really have a good refund policy if your item gets lost in mail chances are you won t get a refund because its up to the seller wether he wants to refund you there s no option to choose the type of mailing you want either honestly i d rather waste for registered mail than give shopee and the seller money for something that i ll never get it s a bad experience on my part i just wish that shopee would refund what the seller refuses to probably wouldn t shop here again,0
15299,ok ok i was delighted by the sight of the vouchers available and when i try to order a product there is this issue of suspicious activity which is very impossible since i ve just tried the app for the first time one thing is that it requires the buyer to take off their vouchers in order to milk money from us and not even following their own terms that s why i gave this one star instead of it just simply abuses it s customers for own gain and my oh my the audacity of the policies be better,0

15337,customer service is useless if you have issue the only help is to message their robot poor customer service if you pay money to buy voucher the refund will not include the voucher cost that you paid shopee is far more better when come to service the delivery is worst than jnt item not deliver however in the delivery status it declared already successful deliver with photo which totally meaningless,0

15352,last time i can pay at eleven useing the scanning code but this time i really dont know to pay at eleven or maybe there no option to pay there even after i ask for customer care help still no responed from the lazada where poor to use after i update this will be make other hw paying at eleven,0

15354,great app no issues secured payment,1
15355,great app easy for online shopping,1
15356,my comments is must the lazada admin be active to send info or update the customer in days before the delivery so that the customer or claimant to prepared cash payments or to stay standby prior to the notice of dated given,1
15357,i hope all deliveries will be serve good and nice,1
15358,this is absolutely ridiculous all my orders were labeled without anyone delivering anything i have been waiting since th dec not a single delivery was made and you guys write failed delivery i want all my items delivered i will not accept cancellation without no effort this is wrong it s like they only deliver when they feel like it are you serious,0

15362,good performance to are products,1
15363,i ve been an avid lazada shopper for years but i am sooooo much disappointed now that the shipping fee for visayas area is already more than php imagine the shipping fee more expensive than the item you ordered please don t try to lose customers lazada,0
15364,interface need improve,1
15365,thanks im satisfied with this app and fast delivery,1
15366,if got zero star i would chose it lazada is louisy put own fault on customer and seller simply cancel the successes transaction then call back the free coupon,0
15367,its easier for me to just shop online but you really have to check the material or quality of the product that you purchase other than that everything deliver smoothly based on my experience,0
15368,ok uy tín,1
15369,i can t a perfect star for now since i didn t yet recieve my order because before i had a bad experience with the product i order here,0
15370,the app ui is not good it is also confusing there are so many room for improvement unlike shopee if you buy gadgets more than k they will give you a voucher k off that you deduct and it is always free shipping the other down side of this app is that there no drop down list for vouchers like shopee so if you want to have free shipping fee is to collect and select it manually before you can use it you can t also change the delivery option of orders,0
15371,it just isn’t worth going to the store any more i spend more in gas and waste time and the selection at lazada is so enormous,1
15372,sometimes very good some items are not the same in the picture whenever they deliver it but its okey,1
15373,the products are very good and you will not be ashamed to sell to people they also follow the rules so i have confidence in it,1
15374,i liked the app before things changed in my opinion this app benefits buyers more than sellers as postage is free also what i hate and find inefficient is that when items are put in the wrong category they d suspend it and notify you but won t let you know which it should be in so you ll have to guess and hope it s the one or it d be suspended again or contact them and stuff so i find it absolutely stupid and i don t see a point,0
15375,improve your chatbot to effectively respond to complex customer concerns or redirect to a live csr my order was tagged as failed delivery while there were no attempts to contact me the seller kept telling me to contact lazada it s frustrating to be given a canned response by the chatbot on failed deliveries this happend multiple times before i was redirected to email lazada directly after that it took more than a week to respond and to refund my purchase do better please,0
15376,nam nay minh canh zdut co hon thay cung hay,1
15377,it was a decent app but the ridiculous amounts of pop up ads which redirected me to open the app was just infuriating has it not occurred to the team who created this design that just because my app is now open doesn t mean that i will buy something or use it if this is just a tactic to draw traffic or ad revenue or the likes then it s really a cheap one in an environment where e commerce apps are popping up everywhere the team should rly reconsider such moves to retain their market share,0
15378,great and easy app,1
15379,very usefull for me specially as a mom a big help,1
15380,it never fails expectations met everytime i use lazada,1
15381,you have clear ordering method furthermore the cod payment option is the best ty,1
15382,you have the most aggressive and moooooost aannnnnooooying ad ever you always force your ad in every app or any online platform that i use and always redirect me to playstore you think you ll have more users on how you force your advertisements and forcefully closing the app we re using and redirecting us to playstore no for me i only get annoyed making me think that i will never ever download your app,0
15383,wish ladaza could provide delivery service which combine all the goods and delivery together,1
15384,worst shopping app just to be honest because the estimated shipping was inaccurate and poor deliveryman s attitude when come to package shipment better to use shopee rather than this app,1

15393,sometimes appp is slow but its fine understandable,1
15394,there are all range of product categories good price which value to money,1
15395,your rider is very rude and not well mannered also your delivery sucks there is no option to redeliver the item even i fill up the form for redeliver if the rider put insufficient cash it will cancel automatically rider should not have authority to cancel your order but because of your system this rider taking advantage if they are lazy to deliver because your house is too far away they will just make issue like example insufficient cash and voila cancel already i complain the rider no action,0
15396,before i buy item for myfriend and i use my fone ac after others time ibuy again another item but addres stil use my friend adress so after paid i must cancel the payment,0
15397,easy to online shoping but some time they send cheap product picture is different and product is different sometime,1

15424,i will like this app better if i can use up to k shopee coin to offset of the purchase reason being that the all day vouchers is set at to the cap of meaning it encourages user to spent to hit the cap and the use of shopee coin is set at to a cap of or k shoppee coins that is how i come up to k shopee coin as of is or k shopee coins in my opinion it is more reward to shop at shopee if purchase is upto,0

15437,a scam site disguised as an online shopping app i somehow got an order delivered to me without me ordering anything at all no notifications nor any pending to receive items on my app this scam site is sending you items you didn t order and you have to pay for it my mother took pity on the delivery guy but the delivery is probably part of the scam too since they all have bad attitudes not including that they handled the item terribly it was literally crushed and flattened use shopee instead,0
15438,good ordering system beware of low quality chinese products,1
15439,good and fast delivery,1
15440,lazada via their customer service agents said that any issues you will encounter will be courier and seller s fault even if the courier is lex ph which they own they have limited view of transactions and will not be able to give you support terrible delivery timeline and does not have obligations to ph government nor consumers the app lags forfeits your earned vouchers and coins bad customer service too they just want your earned money,0

16259,good service,0
16260,difficult to use voucher system difficult to use not practical at all can not clean cart if you accidentally push all items to shopping cart and you have items in your wishlist you have to delete them one by one delivery takes very long time longer and longer looking time,1
16261,sometime wrong item size color quality etc,1
16262,easy to use very convenient app,1
16263,this store is great in terms of content but when it comes to delivery always choose cod because they become sooooo dumb if you pay in advance they either deliver the wrong items or the items are incomplete yeah lazada i get it if you make mistakes systems are not perfect but you frequently make them when customers pay you in advance it s like you are doing it on purpose,0
16264,i will think twice before purchasing at lazada platform after sale service is lousy instead of sending my returned item to seller for refund ninja had kept my item for days before sending it back to me raised issue to lazada via phone call online customer chat service and email it has been days but no updates from lazada the refund request had lapsed in the system due to the delay which had complicated things it seems that after sale service is not lazada s priority thumbs down,0
16265,best app to and hoping more voucher and discount,1
16266,why it is not working on my phone it s too slow and i can t even check out,0
16267,i ordered an item during the baby sale a p stroller that is on sale for p i waited patiently for the delivery it got delayed but the seller assured me it would be shipped out however hours after the seller assured delivery the lazada system automatically cancelled the order the item is still in stock but now i have to pay the full price lazada won t provide me with the discount because they cancelled my order already what a joke what a lie don t be fooled by the sale sign,0
16268,why you always redirect me to your app if i want to buy a thing it doesn t mean i want to install your app,0
16269,somehow lazada apps browsing response faster than shopee apps lazada more innovative lazada own fleet despatch give me comfortable experience though still can t match malaysia pos pos willing to put item into my letterbox,1
16270,great service and quick response,1
16271,your service is such a garbage i just signed in to order this is my first time to try using you apps but then i cant check out dahhh good to know it cannot be useful i uninstall now stop using this app,0
16272,easy to use deliveries are consolidated low quality products are easy to distinguish via customer reviews and ratings,1
16273,for now i m giving laz stars for the easy installation ang registration of the apps still newbie here,1
16274,this power bank is so reliable during the time when we were badly hit by a typhon,1
16275,love the hassle free shopping experience and the promos they have to offer,1
16276,irritating red dots for promotion in messages that cannot be removed even i disabled message notification and it just not taking effect pls fix it,0
16277,it provide its best to serve us but there are sellers who are trying to do bad things that affects lazada s credibilty and other online stores probably lazada will come up with s plan to minimize those issues,1
16278,overall ok can improve more too much popup ui is easy to navigate search recommendation however sucks search for towel bar i put desired length in cm ft then suddenly all previous searches on sneakers vacuum chair lumped together with towel bar very annoying trying to scroll even when i gave feedback in apps unrelated products still show up if i only search for towel bar without the measurement then its fine quite hard to find specific items hope can improve the search engine,1

16331,this is so perpect its so fast to diliver i love it so much,1
16332,one of the most trusted brands for online shopping forget about people misleading you saying lazada sucks or the seller doesn t ship on time always be smart when it comes to online shopping,1
16333,great online shopping apps,1
16334,affiliated sellers are legit and it is very easy to transact,1

16341,hard to find items in english when living in thailand mostly thai even english is the chosen language,0
16342,it is a nightmare to create product order reviews as the photos don t upload properly and the page seems to auto refresh if you took longer everything you wrote down on your review disappears as well as the photos buyer experience is a disaster my order was tagged failed delivery attempt even if there was no real attempt made i can barely tolerate dishonesty definitely deactivating my account soon,0
16343,still toooooo maaaaannnnyyyy notifications upto now soooooo disturbing uninstalling now,0
16344,lazada has an unusual submit order and pay later transaction workflow however the payment option can be improved by showing which bank card is eligible for discount payment before submitting the order this is because the buyer may thought it has fulfilled the discount conditions when the order is placed but only realised that it is not so when making payment later by displaying the info eatlier the buyer can amend the order before submission and not during payment,1
16345,app is more difficult to navigate want to chat with seller re item it fails and cant find the chat option,1
16346,my payment mentod cash and delivery and elevan its missing please help fix it how do i payment,0
16347,everytime i open this app it always ask for an update so annoying,0

16428,bought several items using shopee dealing with local seller have been excellent however foreign sellers are as untrustworthy as shopee support case bought item that does not work from foreign seller engage seller no response for several days when a response came no solution was offered engage shopee support replied but asked to wait for days waited for weeks and no response from shopee tried to contact shopee again non responsive buy shopee products from foreign seller at your own risk you will have no support from shopee or the seller thereafter wanted to give a star but nope since foreign seller are a big part of shopee they dont deserve the extra star disappointed,0

16658,must improve to a more accurate description of products,1
16659,before you install this app let me share my experience buying from them for you to decide i bought from their official store and received an item which was physically damaged the solution they offer is to return or go down to their office to do an exchange it s not even my fault to receive a damaged product yet i have to waste my time going down i checked lazada ezchange policy there is none and vouchers used are not refundable after return is successful first and last time using lazada,0
16660,i m not new using these shopping platform lazada app it s nice to shop here but sometimes it s lagging and can t do what i want because the having a trouble my internet connection is okay so there s a problem in the app sometimes and about the entrepreneurs here there s a trouble about the delivering strategies and schedules in delivering and sometimes the goods or services they ve been delivered is ruined and has a damages please tell that on entrepreneurs who s using these app thanks,1

16675,they give you rebate encourage you to spend but when their system crash and cannot advance your purchase to completion and you ask them to reinstate your rebate they refuse to do it they acknowledge you do your rebate claim in time but say that because when you inform them of the problem the rebate expired already so they cannot help you what a lame excuse in short they are not bothered to help you so they don t empower their customer rep to help you,0
16676,the current package drop off system needs improvement in security i have a package marked as delivered but i cannot keep track of the person who received it on my behalf as they wrote it down as my name i would suggest the delivery guy to call my phone number that i have provided when he is dropping off my package so that i can receive it in person he did not call my phone number and anybody could have taken my package instead,0

16942,be aware of your purchases there is a trap in the apps where user need to use desktop version lazada to download the return slip and cannot get it thru the apps might be their effort to reduce or prevent goods return very unethical,0

16944,hate it really hate it first the items stores are mostly scam second the app is so difficult to navigate third i don t understand why the wallet funds can t be withdrawn fourth the load feature suddenly cancels order for no reason fifth i really don t want to mention anymore my overall experience has been nothing but irritating shopee is way better it seems like they are only enticing bc of the people they pay to endorse them,0

16960,to summarise everything is great coupons discounts ui all great except reviews mind giving us more space to write about there may be customers that only write useless stuff like fast delivery haven t used but looks good but there are others like me that want to give others a better idea of what to expect i ve had to add images of my review written on a notepad just to provide more criticism also let us edit our reviews any time we want we might find problems months later,0

16970,excellent and its very easy for me to shop,1
16971,very impress with the app i have used a number other shopping apps and there is only one thing that i think would need an improvement it would be great if there is stronger security feature before the app can be unlock for used perhaps face recognition or fingerprint might do the work i think most people would not have the habit of logging out from the app so this feature would be good it would prevent unauthorised usage overall still a great experience in using this app,0
16972,not very user friendly filled with random extra stuff everywhere the shipping fee is extra high you can t use much vouchers and the time for delivery takes very long much longer than expected other than that it s an ok app if you re very rich and wanna pay literally almost pesos for shipping when it shouldn t take that much,0

17157,text too small and i m irritated that only a partial list of vouchers show up on their website and using the app is required to get an accurate list i also dislike that they give added discounts for using the app instead of the website none of these features make sense they re a retainer so shouldn t care if the customers use their website or app yet the company clearly has put extra effort into forcing app use please make app and website the same,1

17366,its a great app and you get nice deals but what you are only missing is the option to pay for reliable delivery when you need it customers should decide if they want to pay more and not being forced to default to the russian roulette of disappointing providers that cannot even get out of in reviews when you ask them to update on their partner s delays they will say to hrs for expected reply or you can call their partners yourself amazing attitude,0
17367,not bad but not delivery same day and no pick up point at all pick up points up to seller not shopee service,0
17368,nice items on sale with good quality,1
17369,seriously why does your new ui look exactly like shopee i like the old version a lot better it s user friendly and the orders are easy to track now the entire app is a huge mess hire a proper ui and ux designer someone experienced in app architecture it s so hard to find things from your own account plus i can t buy in bulk anymore without paying each seller a shipping fee ridiculous,0
17370,refund never came requested for a refund but then when item was picked up the refund request got cancelled and its as if the request never happened csr of lazada pretended that they see the requests and promised that the refund will be credited but months passed and nothing,0
17371,giving you star since everytime i go google and click a site it automatically brings me to here lazada which isnt my goal,0
17372,it became easier the shooping lifestyle,1

17377,this app is not respect all mankind especially the attitude towards disabilities people you can see from the advertisement ​,0
17378,easy to use shopping basically thanks lazada i loved you,1
17379,the app does not allow further updates or reviews of purchased products after a more prolonged period of use all reviews have to be completed in less than a month otherwise you will not be able to any more despite attempts to notify the company nothing has been done its as of they do not want to improve future buyers experience include a month review of products like a aliexpress does,0
17380,works well and fast can find good products from reliable sellers,0

17485,too many spam notifications and ads far too intrusive removed after a few days and will just do transactions in a browser,0
17486,you are giving sellers freedom to fool the customers you let them cut off the price where the cut off price was the original value of the product one of the reasons why i buy online is so that i don t have to go outside anymore the return policy is unfair they sent me a wrong product and now i have to go outside and ship it back to the store when i shouldn t have if the store sent the right product so the burden of going outside is mine when the fault was the store s,0

17494,the seller sent me the wrong item a d wrong address which resulted in a failed return and lazada sided with the seller and refused to give me my refund unless the item reaches them but how could it be when they refuse to even pick it up shame on this company for being accomplices to crooks they also don t honor their promises to customers as i have been turned around in circles by their cs for weeks while chasing for that refund they will then give you fake apologies to waste your time,0
17495,prices are affordable and the services are friendly and fast,1
17496,lazada should have authenticity checking some users don t mind additional pricing as long as items are legit and original,1
17497,after the update i can’t use the application anymore it keeps on going back to home what’s wrong with the update now,1
17498,very comfortable for the service,1
17499,nice interface to interact with,1
17500,its good for online shopping and all but once you download it other apps with a lazada ads will forcefully open the lazada app even if you close the ads,0
17501,i found lazada very reliable and so far sellers hardly failed me although there are few poor encounterments that do not get products as described but the feedback and handling of conflicts are excellent keep the good work and keep the product description by the sellers under scrutiny control don t let them ruin the good reputation,1
17502,i downloaded this app solely to make this review will uninstall right after i finish this your disturbing pop up ads on various site are so annoying and irrevelant if people are not using your app that means you cant force them to use it either get better show to the public that you can make a competitive platform and customer will come without having to do these unnessecary ads,0
17503,more variety of products compare to others online shopping platform but absolutely must improve in terms of cashback coins reward,1

17529,too many pop up ads that redirect me to lazada when i click on different websites irritating,0

17546,in general the app is good however the message to seller function has to be improved as the app was forced to close when i used that function and i had to use access lazada via online version to use the same function,1
17547,not very easy to use especially trying to apply vouchers,1
17548,good application and very helpful,1
17549,i very dissapointed on lazada when my orders haven t deliver yet i ask the staff they give me the reply is they need time to send my orders to me and tell me give some time to them but now refund all orders to me without any explanation i have been waited almost a month and lazada and i get nothing very dissapointed to lazada,0
17550,have a quite a long time of using this platform but having a disaster experience of last deal which lazada top selling recommendations dun seller picture unmatching product description is long and detail also long to mislead but mentioned after dispute but customer service refuse my refund the online shopping should leads an accurate and complete which responsible to the goods and honest to their technical faulty instead on judge buyer as a troublesome,0

17566,why you using only a robot when it comes to chat support unlike on shopee there s a real time customer rep who can answer your inquiries would you please romove that cleo and replace a real customer rep that cleo can t answer everything,0
17567,i choose to use a search engine to find the best deals accross various online retailers while lazada does offer competitive prices it s extremely annoying how they keep redirecting from mobile web to the app store to install the app have the option to install at the top of your mobile website if you must but stop forcing a redirect to the app store that way those who want to use the app can choose to be redirected until this is fixed i am taking my business to other platforms on mobile web,0

17639,very invasive advertising it would go as far as to disguising as a missed calls notification and wouldnt stop chiming in with new pointless notifications every mins yes i can turn off notifications but it would be pointless because if i do order something i wouldnt be notified is ads all over the malaysian web not enough for you lazada,0
17640,during these extraordinary times online shopping has proven to be essential at the forefront is lazada it veritably has almost everything and it s all done safely and comfortably at home a wide variety of legit sellers and the occasional scammers unfortunately but the better experiences outweigh the bad delivery is prompt although some are quicker than others depending on the origin various payment methods to choose from professional service at reasonable rates,1

17752,it was grate but not all the time,1
17753,i like that lazada chooses its endorsers carefully tries its best to ensure product reviews authenticity by ensuring most legitimate sellers have accurate product descriptions i just wish it would make its voucher system less complicated by making it available for all purchase types not just specific products at a time,1

17782,i ve been using this app since but til now the categories option is not only inconsistent it does not actually work in most sellers pages,0
17783,a bad experience has changed my rating from to stars should improve refund process by arranging courier to pick up item from customer home if item is damaged wrong most customers will just accept the damaged items because of lengthy inconvenient return refund process which is unfair to them as it is seller s fault,0

17849,this app is solid easy access to good quality shopping items that hitherto would have been quite difficult to get,1
17850,its easy to buy products online but sadly buying original was scarcely enough similar to term finding needle in the haystacks,1
17851,it s very good item and quality all pero yong shipping sobrang tagal lang sana mabilisan papo yan lng lahat ay goods na sakin godbless and more blessings,1
17852,i m starting to get annoyed by this app i always get directed in lazada in every website i used please stop this kind of ads it s annoying,1
17853,you should add a feature that we have the option to totally block those sellers that we don t like or we had bad experience from them like fake items or bad communication it s annoying also when we want to search an authentic items and lot of fake china and local items appearing after using the search button,0
17854,too many bugs and the filter fitur isn t working,0

17869,i almost always find something interesting or exactly what i m looking for ordering is simple and in most cases delivery is quick,1
17870,well i have no complaints about the app itself but i can t understand why the delivery takes so long an item which originated from klang takes days to reach my home in kl all items takes a long time there should be an option for expedited delivery for who are willing to pay the extra i for one have now shifted to shopee item comes in a day or earlier,1
17871,just a money making app not checking their partners if it is legit or not thats why some of the consumer received wrong and defective items lazada sucks better use facebook market place,0

17873,easy shopping mode,0
17874,i like the search engine and filtering of this apps it makes it more easier to find the goods we r looking for,1
