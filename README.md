# Attention-free Language Models

This is the code accompanying my undergraduate thesis. 

Supported models:
- RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM
- TextCNN
- gMLP
- Mamba

To run the code, clone this repository and run the following:

```
python main.py --train_file path/to/train.csv 
--test_file path/to/test.csv
--epochs 10
--batch_size 128
```
